### CDM
# Application
    formative assessment: situational judgement
    summative assessment: IRT
    differences between CDM and IRT
        IRT: unideimentional
        latent traits exist

# Basics
    response vector
    DINO: deterministic input, nosity "or" gate model
    LLM: linear without penalty

# Attributes
    an item measuing and assessing a combination of skills
    distinguish attributes
    determining what attributes to meausre in a limited time range
    attributes (validation) <-> (measurement) items
        validation (of inference): 
            a) attributes provided for peer review; 
            b) revision of attributes; 
            c) repetition until consensus
        think-aloud interview
        post-hoc comparison of test results and subjective ratings
        
# clinical diagnosis
    questions distinguishing levels of symptoms
    phrasing of cutoff points

# G-DINA: general framework
    distinguish deficiencies of anwering each questions
    monotonic property
    GDINA and log-linked have the same effects if it is a saturated model (CDM) 
        DINA assumes the same interaction terms 
        A-CDM eliminates all interaction terms (interaction ==0)
        Reduced Reparameterized Unified Model (RRUM) is the specialized case of CDM
        LLM 


# attribute distribution
    saturated model: 
        2^k options with 2^k-1 parameters to estiamte
    high-order latent trait approach
        2k parameters to estiamte
    constraining the atttribute structure
        learning theory (in sequence) in a particular domain
            linear structure
            divergent structure
            
# model fit evauation
    CDM misspecification
    reduced model: CDM/G-DINA has better fits yet requires larger sample size and more difficult to interpret
    Q-matrix misspecification
        over-specified
        under-specified: cannot be fit in saturated or DINA models
        mixed
    LR for estimated comparisons

# model comparison and selection
    comparison can be done between nested models. models, in fact, are compared with saturated models

# Q-matrix validation
    simpler and comlicated models has the same variability, thus simpler is selected

# DIF detection
  Wald
  LR: 
  Attribute classification accuracy

# model modification
    model check -> item modification -> model comparison -> model selection

abstract={The present transport system of the Federal Republic of Germany has reached a high standard for all modes and is capable of meeting the demand for mobility and for a free choice of the means of transport. Road transport is predominating, performing 80% of passenger transport and 50% of goods transport. The network of the federal motorways (Autobahnen) today has a total length of 7500 km. Environment protection, energy policy and traffic safety led to a reconsideration of transport policy priorities. Qualitative aspects of road construction are now being emphasized, and more importance is attached to the cooperation of all modes of transport. The improvement of the federal rail network is a principal target, and the implementation of attractive urban transit system is to be continued. The basis for federal investment decisions is the Federal Traffic Infrastructure Plan, aiming at intermodal planning and evaluation in consideration of cost‐benefit analyses. The role of the Länder of the Federal Republic is largely restricted to regional planning and financing, but the influence of regional authorities on the federal transport policy, as a matter of fact, is considerable. Transport regulations are pursued according to the principle of a ‘controlled’ market. State interventions occur with respect to capacities and tariffs. Long‐distance road haulage is subject to licensing in order to protect the railways against this competitor. In the fields of passenger transport, a better cooperation of public operators is aimed at. Financial problems require subsidies to be limited especially as far as the railways are concerned. Regulations in the field of transport as well as technical standards are aiming at a reduction of harmful effects of traffic. The Federal Republic of Germany, traversed by principal European traffic arteries, has to take into account the international dimension of its transport policy. © 1982 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Intermodal freight terminals are land intensive, in that each requires a substantial dedicated land area, and they are usually sited within urban areas. Some are locationally constrained due to mode dominance (e. g. , a container port must be located at waterside). For these reasons, developers and users of new intermodal freight terminals may find themselves limited in their choice of locations. Existing facilities may also have limited opportunities for redevelopment or expansion or both. In addition to natural locational constraints on intermodal freight terminal site selection, there can also be a number of social or environmental constraints. Thus, due to possible zoning restrictions based on environmental or other similar constraints, developers and users of intermodal freight terminals may find their locational and operational options severely limited, or exercisable only at drastically reduced levels of efficiency. Special land use zoning or urban land development under the joint-use concept is recommended in order to assure user viability of new or expanded intermodal freight facilities to serve all forms of goods transport.},

Shipper's agents are concerned mainly with intermodal traffic, most of which they forward by piggyback. Although shipper's agents existed well before piggyback, it was piggyback and deregulated railroad piggyback rates that gave them new opportunities to promote intermodality. Shipper's agents are the epitome of middlemen: they do whatever it takes to put together a cost-effective, quality intermodal package. They buy piggyback service from railroads on a wholesale basis and resell it to shippers at less cost than if shippers bought it directly. The agents take advantage of multiple-container or minimum quarterly rail rates by bringing in traffic from many shippers.},

abstract={Since developing countries have comparatively low motor-vehicle indices, cars are responsible for moving relatively small shares of their urban population and large proportions of it are reliant on public transportation. Moreover, as public transit is poorly organized and primarily comprises bus systems which compete among themselves and with private cars for road space, the bus transit user is penalized as to time, comfort, and safety. Although it is likely in the short and medium terms that the bus will continue to be the principal mode of public transportation in view of the scarcity of funds for large scale investments, inter-modal solutions should be sought for public transport, with emphasis on maximum improvement of operating conditions of buses and existing rail transit facilities.-from Author},

abstract={Filter and cascade impactor samples of suspended particles were collected in-stack and at distances up to 64 km downwind in the plume of a large western coal-fired power plant equipped with both electrostatic precipitators (ESP) and venturi wet particulate scrubbers (VWS) to investigate modifications of the particulate signatures of minor and trace elements during transport. Samples were analyzed for 40 elements by instrumental neutron activation analysis. Precipitator malfunction during the experiment caused greater than normal emission of large particles, and concentrations of As, Zn, Sb, Mo, Ga, W, U, V and Ba in near-plume particles collected on filters were enriched relative to their concentrations in stack particles by factors of 1.4 to 2.5, presumably because of sedimentation of very large particles. Selenium was enriched by up to 6-fold (plume:stack). However, enrichment of elements in the plume relative to more typical in-stack particles were insignificant for all elements except Se, which was enriched 2.3-fold. Concentrations of Se on particles in the stack and plume suggest that most of the Se vapor in stack gases became associated with aerosol particles soon after emission. Thus although significant post-emission modifications of elemental signatures of particles may occur for poorly controlled plants, little change is expected for well-controlled plants equipped with ESPs except for Se. Source signatures measured for Se must account for vapor deposition. Impactor data showed a preferential decrease in the concentrations of the above elements in submicrometer particles; suggesting that either intermodal coagulation or size selective sampling losses were important. The impactor data further suggest that enrichment-particle-size profiles for VWS emissions were not conservative during transport. © 1989.},

abstract={The movement of freight consumes about 6.2 EJ of energy annually, and accounts for about 19% of US oil consumption. Environmental concerns, notably urban air quality and global climate change, have increased attention on fossil fuel use and ways to reduce it. The freight sector has been largely overlooked, although there are numerous opportunities for reductions in energy use in this sector. Although trucks carry less than one-third of all freight (as measured by tonne-km), they account for over 80% of freight energy use - and their energy use is likely to continue to grow rapidly. Options to reduce freight truck energy use include improving technical energy efficiency through improved technology and operations; and shifting freight to other, more energy efficient modes. Demonstration runs of heavy trucks combining commercially available technologies, careful driving, and optimal driving conditions have obtained impressive energy efficiencies - 50-70% above that of the current fleet. If all heavy trucks achieved this level of energy efficiency, oil consumption could be reduced by about 1.0 EJ. Although real-world operating conditions would likely yield reduced energy efficiencies, these results do suggest the potential for a considerable energy saving from greater use of commercially available technologies. For long-haul movements, trains are often more energy efficient than trucks. However the two modes differ in many other ways as well - trucks are often faster and more flexible, while trains are often less expensive. The recent growth in intermodal movements ties the two modes together, making use of each mode's strengths. At present trains and trucks do compete in some long-haul markets, and additional savings of up to 0.2-0.5 EJ may be possible by shifting more long-haul freight from trucks to trains. Policy options to promote reduced energy use in freight transport include energy taxes, regulations such as performance mandates and improved speed limit enforcement, changes in Federal procurement and R&D, early retirement programs, and promotion of intermodal movements. In many cases reduced energy use can reduce costs and thereby improve the freight system overall; however some policy options to reduce energy use - such as reductions in speed limits - may adversely affect other goals (in this case, speed of delivery); policy decisions must recognize these trade-offs. © 1995.},

We estimate that the average increase has been 2.3% for goods and 3.1% for passengers. All predictions point to a continuation of this trend. The areas of conflict between transport and the environment are known; they take the form of energy consumption, operational pollution, land intrusion, congestion and risks inherent to the carriage of dangerous goods. To correct environmental inefficiencies and improve the environmental performance of the transport sector, requires a full range of measures and initiatives adapted to the needs and characteristics of the different modes. They will also need to allow for the progressive integration of the modes in order to derive maximum benefits, economic and environmental, from intermodal transport in the largest possible sense.},

abstract={This paper provides information on radio-frequency identification (RFID) and its potential applications in the construction industry. RF1D involves the use of miniature read/write transponders that are capable of storing data in harsh environments. These transponders can be used in situations where optical scanning is not practical because vision is blocked or because labels fall off or become unreadable due to dust, dirt, or other contaminants. The technology is currently used in several applications outside the construction industry (e.g., reading meters, preventing theft of store merchandise, tracking railroad cars and intermodal freight containers, collecting tolls, and performing agricultural and animal research), and is seen as having potential in the construction industry. Potential construction applications for RFID technology discussed here include concrete processing and handling, cost coding for labor and equipment, and materials control. Conceptual design systems for these applications are also considered and developed. Discussion of limitations of RFID technology for construction applications include proximity of equipment, nearby metallic objects, costs, and workforce attitudes. Conclusions are drawn regarding possible future impacts on construction industry. © 1995 ASCE.},

abstract={The Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) may be the most powerful of all environmental laws affecting transportation. They are intended to significantly affect transportation decision-making, not only to achieve air quality goals but also to affect broader environmental goals related to land use, travel mode choice, and reductions in vehicle miles traveled. The CAAA require greater integration of transportation and air quality planning, and assign a greater responsibility to transportation plans and programs for reducing mobile source emissions. By expanding the requirements for determining the conformity of transportation plans, programs, and projects with State Implementation Plans for air quality, and by expanding the use of highway funding sanctions to enforce those requirements, the CAAA ensure a continuing linkage between transportation and environmental goals. While the CAAA give transportation and air quality decision-makers the mandate to better coordinate their respective planning processes, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 offers the tools to help carry out that mandate. Consequently, this paper summarizes the transportation and air quality provisions of both of these Acts and their relationships. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={In combination, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) are innovative and aggressive efforts to move US cities toward integrated transportation and air quality planning. Under these complementary laws, air quality has become a major national transportation goal. In areas with serious air pollution, air quality will be a major consideration in determining the future shape of urban transportation. This paper considers how the CAAA and ISTEA combine to provide an innovative national policy approach of interest to countries seeking to encourage sustainable development in urban centers. The CAAA mandates measurable and enforceable air quality targets. Nation-wide standards are set for acceptable levels of carbon monoxide, ground level ozone, and small particulates. ISTEA includes directions for transportation planners and decision-makers to follow to reach air quality and other goals - transportation planning must emphasize system efficiency, and for cities with severe air pollution, transportation projects are expected to contribute to cleaner air. Each urban area has flexibility in how it applies this framework to reflect its priorities and solve its problems. Strict federal sanctions provide incentives for compliance with both laws.

abstract={The awareness of the consequences of a further rise in transport for the environment has not only been a matter of concern for scientific researchers but also for planners and policy-makers. In fact, the environment is now an ever present factor in the new political agenda and issues of excessive traffic congestion and global atmospheric pollution are increasingly attracting administrators' attention. One of the most important scenarios proposed for the protection of the environment, taking into account the adverse effects of traffic, is the redistribution of freight transport demand. In this paper the Italian situation has been tested, evidencing productive sectors and regions really benefiting from a more effective redistribution of trade flows among existing links on the freight network. This pattern is estimated by evaluating substitution elasticities before and after the introduction of a pollution tax. Numerical simulations, in terms of reduction of pollution emissions and transportation costs, are also provided. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract={This paper proposes the development of an activity-based model of travel that inte-grates household activities, land use patterns, traffic flows, and regional demographics. The model is intended as a replacement of the traditional Urban Transportation Planning System (UTPS) modeling system now in common use. Operating in a geographic-information system (GIS) environment, the model's heart is a Household Activity Simulator that determines the locations and travel patterns of household members daily activities in 3 categories: mandatory, flexible, and optional. The system produces traffic volumes on streets and land use intensity patterns, as well as typical travel outputs. The model is particularly well suited to analyzing issues related to the Clean Air Act and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). Implementation would, ideally, require an activity-based travel diary, but can be done with standard house-interview travel surveys. An implementation effort consisting of validation research in parallel with concurrent model programming is recommended. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={This paper investigates the potential for increased intermodal transport, in particular the substitution of road with maritime transport along coastal and short-sea routes. Such shifts may not alleviate all localised problems but any cut in the total volume of road traffic will benefit both the economy and environment (European Commission, 1995). The data are drawn from an ongoing research project funded by the European Union (EU), entitled 'European Marine Motorways'. There are a number of strands to this project, but the material used here relates to the perceptions of UK transport managers on road and maritime transport, and their thoughts on the likely industry demand for a hypothetical fast ferry service running between the UK and Spain. In order to encourage intermodality, in particular a move from road to sea, policy makers and commerical providers need to respond by introducing measures which affect both transportation costs (TC) and non-transportation costs (NTC). Transport decisions are best explained by the constrained optimisation model, with road perceived as being best placed to meet many of the service constraints imposed by the market, particularly the ability to offer continual information on the location of cargo and driver, which has been described as flexible control. By contrast, maritime transport was seen as inflexible, unrealiable and susceptible to changes in the weather. In short, maritime transport was found to compare poorly with road on key service variables. Some possible policy options have been examined, the most important of which was to work on a number of fronts simultaneously: improving the TCs and NTCs associated with maritime transport while worsening the TCs and NTCs of road transport.},

Forces of change include the completion of the Interstate System, advances in information technologies, and the emergence of a global economy. Transportation users seek high-quality service characterized by speed, flexibility, and responsiveness within a competitive environment that assures low cost. The public investment in infrastructure has diminished while control shifts to state and local governments. A debate is underway as to how the planning processes should evolve. Among the new challenges to be faced is the need for improvements in the freight sector, where both private and public interests are strong. This article addresses a complex aspect of intermodal planning which deals with multistate concerns. Specifically, it addresses three requirements for corridor planning: data, analysis tools, and institutional structures. The article also discusses a redefined federal role and the need for cooperation among all governmental levels and for partnerships between the public and private sectors.},

abstract={In addition to fuels, passenger and freight transport require vehicles and infrastructure. As with fuels, the provision of goods and services that are needed for the operation of transport involves the consumption of energy and the emission of greenhouse gases. The energy consumed and greenhouse gases emitted due to fuel use by vehicles are referred to as direct requirements, while indirect requirements of energy and greenhouse gases are embodied in the goods and services mentioned before. Indirect requirements form a significant part of the total energy and greenhouse gases required for a given transport task. They depend on the transport mode, ranging from 10% to 50% for freight transport and from 25% to 65% for passenger transport. These indirect requirements have to be taken into account when options for reducing the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of the transport sector are to be evaluated.

abstract={The market share of trucks in European freight transport is still growing. Avoiding road congestion and other environmental reasons makes a modal shift towards barge, train and pipes necessary. This shift entails much more than the substitution of truck kilometres by train or ship kilometres. First, trains and ships do not usually provide door-to-door transport services. A transhipment of freight is necessary to create intermodal logistic chains. Second, transhipment usually entails high costs and loss of time. There are, however, encouraging developments: strategically located multimodal terminals can efficiently tranship freight from one mode to another, operating 24 h a day. This transhipment can be implemented in an automated, robotized manner. Such technological innovations provide terminals with a promising future. Third, freight flows may be too thin to guarantee a satisfactory loading efficiency. The solution can be found by rearranging logistic chains to bundle freight and achieve thicker freight flows. This contribution describes - from a Dutch perspective - current problems of multi-modality in European freight transport and some promising developments concerning terminals and networks. A technological and organizational breakthrough towards multimodality in freight transport is anticipated. This implies a change in the spatial configuration of freight flows and multimodal terminals along with the optimal choice of a combination of modes. This paper indicates an optimalization problem on a European scale, aiming at the minimization of private costs and a reduction of environmental costs.

We will particularly address the critical decision factors faced by terminal operators in terms of strategic importance, location and network configuration of freight terminals by employing Porter's competitive focus. First, the industry competitors in the freight terminal market will be analysed. Second, the buyers of the freight terminal services will be described, followed by the suppliers of the terminal infrastructure. Other competitive forces are the potential entrants into the terminal market and the substitutes for the use of freight terminals. An additional competitive force is added to our conceptual model in the form of the terminal environment. After the outline of this analytical framework of the freight terminal market, it is possible to identify where the economic power is located in the terminal market and how the positions of the different players in the market can be enhanced. The analysis will further address(de)regulation competences for different governmental levels involved in terminal activities.

abstract={The federal ports system in Canada faces considerable challenges and opportunities from the rapidly changing international trading environment in which they operate. Global trade has grown as a result of tariff reductions and removal of non-tariff barriers emanating from successive rounds of GATT trade discussions. Ports in Canada and the U.S. have been pressured to improve productivity to handle increasing amounts of cargo in a timely manner. Trans-border trade continues to grow due to the FTA and subsequent NAFTA. However, most continental trade is transported by surface mode to the detriment of ports and the coastal trade in both countries. Improvements to transport technology and economic deregulation challenge ports due to the growth of an integrated intermodal system serving a continental transportation network. Such integrated intermodalism enables the diversion of containerized cargo through load-centre ports in both countries. The many challenges facing Canadian ports are partly driving the current port reform process. Steps have been taken over the past several years to involve the Canadian transportation industry in the development of a national marine policy. The Canada Marine Act, which recently was given royal assent, shifts major commercial ports towards a more businesslike setting. However, this may not be enough, as ports need to be freed from the strictures of the federal government to operate independently in a continental competitive transportation environment. © 1999 NRC.},

abstract={Our tale starts with two town greens in Vermont. Both were built within the last five years. Both benefited from federal transportation funding. Both are former brownfields. And both reflect the leadership of local planners. But the distance dividing these two downtown parks is far more than the 30 miles between them. It represents a sea change at the Vermont Agency of Transportation and at many other state transportation departments across the country. The changes reflect the states' improved understanding of the federal transportation enhancements program and their willingness to be more flexible in implementing it. Eight years after authorization-first under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 and then under its 1998 successor, the Transportation Equity Act of the 21st Century-the program remains a generous source of funding for community-friendly projects. Those projects range from landscaping and scenic view protection to historic preservation, trail construction, and pedestrian and bicycle paths. Total project spending nationwide topped $2 billion as of June 1998, and $3.8 billion is available for additional projects through 2004. The program has transformed local landscapes in nearly every state. It has also helped many state transportation departments to transform their decision making, their project management policies, and in a few cases, their very missions. The entire Vermont Agency of Transportation really supports this program, from the top on down. Three reasons for the state's commitment stand out: first, the program's emphasis on environmental protection; second, the state's economic dependence on tourism; and third, the good will generated by successful enhancement projects.},

abstract={Efforts to reduce energy use in freight transportation usually center around 'mode-based' approaches, namely improving the energy efficiency of energy intensive modes, such as truck, and shifting more freight to energy efficient modes, such as rail. In the first part of this paper we review the recent trends and future prospects for these mode-based approaches, finding that despite substantial improvement in the technological efficiency of freight modes and robust growth in the use of intermodal rail since 1980, total freight energy use across all modes in the US has grown by approximately 33%, with proportional growth in carbon emissions. In the second part of the paper we propose use of a 'commodity-based' approach, in which freight energy use is disaggregated by contribution of major commodity groups, in order to support efficiency improvement at the commodity level. Two potential applications of the commodity based approach, namely (1) life cycle analysis of energy use for major commodity groups and (2) spatial analysis of freight patterns, are demonstrated using the 1993 US Commodity Flow Survey data. Results of these preliminary findings suggest that commodity groups vary widely in the ratio of energy use in production to energy use in transport, and that for many commodity groups, there may be substantial opportunities for saving energy by redistributing flow patterns. Through development of the commodity-based approach, we also identify the collaborative involvement of shippers and carriers as a key point in improving energy efficiency, since it can be used to both make the mode-based approach more effective and address new issues such as the underlying growth in tonne-km. Benefits for air quality and other transportation issues are also discussed.

From a comprehensive point of view, responses to these challenges have profound consequences on all key elements of management that is to say organisation, human resources, marketing and development of new products, in addition to the traditional fleet management and operations.

The current situation is generally characterised by policies that favour motorisation and violate fundamental elements of sustainability. Accordingly, a new vision of sustainable transportation is required, one that incorporates intermodalism for both passengers and freight. Creating a sustainable intermodal system necessitates overcoming many obstacles and can be achieved only with appropriate policy and decision-making systems that incorporate genuine public participation. However, existing decision-making processes and public involvement mechanisms are inadequate. New approaches need to be developed and implemented if the new transportation paradigm is to be realised.},

abstract={A periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Particulate Matter by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will assess the standards with respect to levels, particle size, and averaging times. Some members of the scientific community in the United States and Europe have suggested the use of PM1 instead of PM2.5 as the fine particle measurement standard. This proposed standard is intended to reduce the influence of coarse particle sources on PM2.5, because some evidence suggests that PM1–2.5 is dominated by coarse particulate matter (PM) sources. In this study, coarse (PM2.5–10), intermodal (PM1–2.5), and fine (PM2.5) mass concentrations at four different sites are measured with continuous and time-integrated sampling devices. The main objective is to compare variations in these three size ranges while considering the effects of location, sources, weather, wind speed, and wind direction. Results show strong correlations between PM1 and intermodal PM in receptor sites. The contribution of PM1–2.5 to PM2.5 is highest in the summer months, most likely due to enhanced long-range transport. Coarse PM is poorly correlated with intermodal PM. Continuous data suggest that PM1 is growing into PM1–2.5 via complex processes involving stagnation of the aerosol during high relative humidity conditions, followed by advection during daytime hours. © 2004 Air &amp; Waste Management Association.},

abstract={Within the framework of the promotion of the environmental friendly modes, the European Commission has launched a number of research projects aiming at evaluating technical and organisational innovations that can improve the performance of the freight transport operations in the rail sector. The scope of this paper is to present a modelling approach focusing on the comparative evaluation of conventional and advanced rail-road terminal equipment. The set of models used, consists of an expert system for the terminal design, a model simulating terminal operations and a macro-model implementing rail operating forms and assigning freight flows in the transport network. This approach stems from the fact that the time savings due to efficient terminal transshipment can be used effectively only in combination with advanced rail operating forms. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The results of a literature review and a survey of 70 state-level transportation agencies were synthesized to identify important intermodal issues. With the understanding that identifying issues is the first step to addressing them, review and survey results were used to develop a list of common intermodal transportation planning issues facing the United States. A set of course notes for a graduate level course on intermodal transportation planning was also developed. The course materials were developed in PowerPoint format for use in distance learning applications, such as interactive classrooms connecting the three UTCA campuses and a Web-based course intended for use on and off campus.},

abstract={With the advent of the ISPS code, an impressive array of regulations has been put in place to safeguard European Union (EU) ports from acts of terrorism and other unlawful acts. Also, the ‘Prestige’ tanker disaster has triggered important legislation that may affect ports, as regards safety and environmental protection. This paper takes a look at current port safety, security and environmental protection legislation, vis-à-vis the general policy thrust of the EU in the area of transport, and discusses the situation faced by the port sector and EU intermodal transport in the new regime. It is argued that we have a long way to go towards reaching policy goals as regards shifting cargo from land to sea. Challenges and opportunities are identified, and recommendations on how to improve the current situation are made. © 2005 Palgrave Macmillan Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background, Goal and Scope. The ecoinvent database is a reference work for life cycle inventory data covering the areas of energy, building materials, metals, chemicals, paper and cardboard, forestry, agriculture, detergents, transport services and waste treatment. Generic inventories are available for freight and passenger transport including air, rail, road, and water transport. The goal of freight transport modelling is to provide background data for transport services, which occur between nearly any two process steps of a product system. This paper presents and discusses the model structure, basic assumptions and results for selected freight transport services. Main Features. Transport services are divided into several datasets referred to as transport components. In addition to vehicle operation (comprising vehicle travel and pre-combustion), infrastructure processes such as vehicle maintenance, manufacturing and disposal, as well as transport infrastructure construction, operation and disposal, are also modelled. In order to link the various transport components to the functional unit of one tonne kilometre (tkm), so-called demand factors are determined. In the case of transport infrastructure that is not exclusively used by freight transport, allocation is essential. The respective allocation parameters employed for line infrastructure construction/disposal and operation datasets (including land use) are yearly Gross-tonne kilometre performance (Gtkm) and kilometric vehicle/train performance. Results are presented for selected environmental exchanges related to gaseous emissions (climate change gases, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons), heavy metal (zinc and cadmium) emissions to soil and air, as well as BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand), and land use. Particle emissions are further distinguished into fine (PM2.5) and coarse (diameter between 2.5 and 10 μm) particles. The results presented comprise both an intra- and intermodal comparison. Results and Discussions. A comparison of Swiss and European rail transport reveals considerably lower emissions from Swiss rail transport due to the almost exclusive use of hydropower as traction energy. For gaseous emissions, freight transport by water or rail exhibits considerably better performance than road transport (65-92% less gaseous emissions). As far as zinc and cadmium emissions to soil are concerned, water and rail transport produce less than 1% of the emissions resulting from road transport for either pollutant. For zinc and cadmium emissions to air, road transport has the highest emissions; however, the emissions due to water and rail transport range from 2 to 18% of the emission levels arising from road transport. Particle emissions show a more diverse pattern. Whilst fine particle emissions due to water and rail transport are considerably lower than road transport, rail transport with respect to coarse particles performs worse than road transport. Dominance analysis reveals the importance of infrastructure processes. For instance, the NMHC-emissions of infrastructure processes account for 40%, 30% and 50% of emissions for road, rail and barge transport, respectively. For the demand factor of infrastructure operation, a sensitivity analysis of the employed allocation factor was performed, revealing no sensitivity for gaseous emissions and particles. On the other hand, considerable changes in both emission levels and in the ranking of transport modes is observed for land occupation. Finally, we varied selected operation parameters for road transport, resulting in considerable reductions of CO2 and NOx emissions of up to 60%. In one extreme case (load factor: 100%), NOx emissions for vehicle operation of a lorry are lower than for inland water transport. Only as a result of the considerably higher NOx emissions occurring in infrastructure processes does road transport score worse than water transport, with the ranking remaining the same as for the generic data presented in ecoinvent 2000. Conclusions and Perspectives. The provided datasets allow for a preliminary screening of the importance of transport processes within a product life cycle. In the cases for which transport processes are identified as sensitive for the overall outcome of certain product life cycle or for transport specific comparisons, the modular structure and transparent documentation of demand factors allows for an easy and transparent integration of more case-specific data for selected transport components.},

abstract={Deposition of terrestrial aerosols is one of the major means of fertilizing the oligotrophic ocean waters. In order to understand the biogeochemical significance of aerosols transported from the Asian continent, and deposited over the East China Sea, we studied their chemical properties by making continuous measurements on board R/V Hakuho Maru in autumn, a season of lower dust events. Outflows of anthropogenic substances were observed over the East China Sea. The average concentration of non-sea-salt (nss)-SO4 2- in aerosols was 8.7±6.8 μg m-3, a value typical for polluted atmosphere of a highly industrialized urban area in South China. Fine mode NH4+ mainly occurred as (NH 4)2SO4 and/or NH4HSO4 while in coarse mode it was formed from intermodal coagulation of ammonium particles in fine and coarse aeorosols. On the other hand, the mean concentration of NO3- (1.8±1.2 μg m -3) was lower than that in the urban atmosphere. Non-sea-salt SO 42- were derived from combustion sources and marine biological processes, the latter accounting to 0-38%. Nitrate in coarse mode was associated with Ca2+ and Na+ perhaps due to replacement reactions. Our estimates of the annual atmospheric aerosol deposition fluxes of NH4+ and NO3- to the East China Sea were 270 Gg N yr-1 and 160 Gg N yr-1, respectively. These atmospheric inputs are comparable to the riverine inputs of the Changjiang River. The total combined nitrogen deposition could account for a biological fixation of about 2.5 Tg C (approximately 0.1-9% of the new production) in the East China Sea annually, which could actually be larger since the autumn season experience minimal dust storms. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Much has been written and spoken about short sea shipping within the European Union (EU) as a means of shifting goods from road to sea and of achieving a sustainable economic development. However, this shift is far from being a general reality, despite the few individual, and success stories that have taken place and the EUROSTAT data suggest that the overall effort has contributed very little towards attaining this desired shift. In the light of this, research was conducted to discover how to put short sea shipping on a more competitive level within European multimodal logistics supply chains. This paper aims at identifying service attributes of short sea shipping operations within multimodal transport chains by means of a questionnaire and, for that, examines the short sea shipping environment and contemporary European logistics trends. The analysis is based on empirical research, involving logistics operators, shippers' associations and intermodal rail operators, and allows an evaluation (based on statistical techniques) of the short sea shipping industry and its competitors. It extends previous work by considering these short sea shipping attributes within a multimodal transport context. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This paper explores collaborative transport planning among governmental authorities where jurisdictions overlap and the lines of authority are ambiguous or unclear-an increasingly common situation in this era of waning trade and travel restrictions. We do this by examining the experience of mandated collaborative transportation planning among state departments of transportation (DOTs) and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) in the USA following a significant change to national surface transportation policy in the early 1990s. To understand how state transport planning and plans changed following the inter-jurisdictional collaboration mandated by passage of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), we examine recent statewide transport planning in 14 of the largest US states and conducted interviews with 66 state and regional planners. We find that, despite the myriad topics that state DOTs tried to include within their comprehensive statewide plans, these plans have had, at best, a limited influence on metropolitan transport planning and activities. Despite this, we find that the mandated collaborative planning did help to increase inter-agency coordination on issues (1) where network or environmental externalities transcend regional boundaries, (2) that require the political clout of a higher-level governmental authority to enforce locally unpopular decisions, or (3) that take advantage of institutional economies of scale. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={This paper explores whether the risk of a toxic release during transport is greater in poor and minority neighborhoods using a combination of mapping and statistical methods. Cluster analysis is used to examine the density of facilities and transport spill events as well as test for the spatial covariance between facilities and spills. Strong clustering of transport spills is evident, as well as clustering between factory sites and transport spills. A spatial model demonstrates raised rates of transport spills surrounding clusters of toxic firms. Most spills in Los Angeles occurred within 2 km of an intermodal facility. The last step of the analysis compares risk and facility clustering between neighborhoods and socio-economic groups, finding that hazmat spills during transport disproportionately occur in Latino neighborhoods in Los Angeles. The results clarify the spatial distribution of risk and nuisance from freight in urban landscapes. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Present performance of railway transport sector is determined by two groups of factors. The first one relates to the changes of external economic environment of railway performance, while the second one deals with the internal changes in the railway transport sector. These factors determine priority directions of railway transport sector development. A good example of such development is implementation of intermodal services, which in turn foresee concept of integration of various logistics service providers. In this paper assumption is made, that implementation of intermodal services as well as integration of various logistics services providers can not be reached without proper nodes on the multimodal transport networks. Therefore definition, urge and some key functions of intermodal terminal are discussed. Later theoretical model of such terminal performance is presented. The paper ends with conclusions about the meaning of intermodal terminal to the increase of quality level of railway transport sector performance. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

abstract={In Western Europe, the rail freight industry is presently being liberalised, and many of the new intermodal services involve cooperation between various actors, including the port authorities, shipping lines, port terminal operators, and logistics providers. These cooperative relations are presently multiplying as the actors seek to position themselves in a partially deregulated rail freight environment. The objective of this paper is to understand the roles played by the different actors and the forms of cooperation that are necessary to mount intermodal rail services. The authors demonstrate that despite being bound by a common policy, a wide range of relationships between the actors has emerged. The new services have the potential to reinvigorate rail freight transport in Europe. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing.},

abstract={Most of the transport literature only looks at mode alternatives in competition with each other, rather than exploring the potential for cooperation. This paper examines this possibility by making the case for aircraft and high speed train (HST) substitution under conditions of intermodal integration. In the model suggested, airlines use railway services as additional spokes in their network of services from a hub airport to complement and substitute for existing aircraft services. Airlines benefit from the slots that are freed and they can support mode substitution. Society gains from the social and economic benefits of better integrated transport services at a lower environmental cost. This paper examines this model of integration at Heathrow airport against the background of UK air transport policy and assesses the benefits and limitations of it. The conclusion reached is that some railway infrastructure should also be seen as part of the air transport infrastructure. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The "state-of-the-art" of the present global European situation is in desperate need for a new approach to development of urban and rural environment with an interdisciplinary approach, when introducing the elements of transport infrastructure and transport infrastructure landscape into space and environment. In order to reach a decision regarding the location of a certain transport logistic terminal some constraints (technical and technological as well as financial) should be considered. As part of the process trying to respond to these constraints, associated primarily with the traffic conditions at the appointed network locations, a careful evaluation in respect to cargo flows and infrastructure connections as well as spatial planning should be performed. Morphological indicators, which directly and indirectly affect the structure and the form of the transport infiastructure elements - transport logistic terminals, are extracted and presented in the paper. At this point, the paper concludes that the laying down and the evaluation of transport infrastructure elements are based on two categories of morphological elements: Constructed morphological elements (all constructions and their elements), and Natural morphological elements (topography, climate, vegetation, etc.). The presented spatial methodology deals with the interactions between the constructed and natural morphological elements - the quality and the characteristics of the design are added to both groups. Findings and projections acquired on the basis of a spatial evaluation and transport logistic analysis constitute, together with financial-economic assumptions, the basis for elaborating a business plan - a significant element in the decision-making process regarding the development of a transport logistic terminal.},

abstract={In light of increasing congestion of the European road network, intermodal transport featuring inland waterway transport can offer a good alternative to road transport. This alternative can however only be judged as good if on one hand it does not cost the shipper more than road transport does and on the other hand does not counteract the EU's environmental goals. If this is in fact the case which requires a calculation methodology, implemented in a tool. Although much research has been done with regard to both cost and emissions of transport, until recently, no tool existed that could combine both factors for micro-level assessment of intermodal chains featuring inland waterway transport. DIINAMO, the model developed at Delft University of Technology for just this purpose, aims to fill that void. This paper describes the recent research efforts in Europe with regard to inland waterway transport and intermodal transport as well as the background and the workings of DIINAMO.},

Internal costs consist of the operational-private costs borne by the transport and intermodal terminal operators, and the time costs of goods tied in transit. The external costs include the costs of the impacts of both networks on society and the environment such as local and global air pollution, congestion, noise pollution, and traffic accidents. The model is applied to the simplified configurations of both networks using the inputs from the European freight transport system. The objective is to investigate some effects of European Union policy, which aims to internalise the external costs of transport, on the prospective competition between two networks from a social perspective. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Metropolitan areas serving as major nodes within the international trade network are particularly affected. In California, state regulation was imposed on port operations in an effort to mitigate congestion and air pollution associated with increased port-related trade. This paper presents an evaluation of the outcomes of California Assembly Bill (AB) 2650 at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. The legislation permitted terminals to adopt either gate appointments or off-peak operating hours as a means of reducing truck queues at gates. There is no evidence of reduced queuing or transaction times, and hence that AB 2650 did not result in reduced truck emissions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The introduction of environmentally friendly electric/hybrid vehicles for the pre- and post haulage operation would mean a further enhancement leading to a more complete ecological intermodal transport chain. PPH operations are usually no longer than 30 km, and, hence, could possibly be handled by electric or hybrid vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) combine electric and other drive systems, such as internal combustion engines, gas turbines and fuel cells. Hybrid electric vehicles merge the zero pollution and high efficiency benefits of electric traction with the high fuel energy density benefits of an energy source or thermal engine. The use of electrically driven vehicles for goods distribution has already been successfully proven in international demonstration projects, such as ELCIDIS. Transport of intermodal units (such as ISO containers), however, requires electric/hybrid heavy-duty goods vehicles, which are not readily available on the market, but for which the technology exists. Different possibilities are assessed as to their technical, financial, organizational and environmental feasibility and suitability. This analysis is based on a typical mission for pre-and post haulage operations, such as type of trips, distance, frequency, urban/suburban, etc.},

abstract={The last several decades have witnessed very substantial public sector investment in roadway and railway infrastructure throughout the EU. The seaway has tended not to be supported to the same degree, possibly due to the mistaken assumption by policymakers that the seaway represents some kind of free highway, and is therefore not deserving of public subsidy in the same way as roadways and railways. To a limited extent, the evolving EU Motorways of the Sea policy appears to recognize these distortions, and mechanisms are now being put in place to enable short sea shipping to develop further. Acceptance by the European Commission that short sea shipping offers the potential to hold back the dramatic growth in road freight transport throughout the EU reflects the fact that policy is now beginning to move more positively in favour of maritime intermodal transport solutions. Recent EU-funded research on the subject of Motorways of the Sea as well as increased EU grant aid reflects this shift and highlights the important role of the EU in this regard. Analysis of sea motorways in practice demonstrates the substantial modal shift that can be achieved by innovative carriers using advanced ship technology supported by appropriate policies, and/or due to specific environmental circumstances. However, there continues to be a mismatch whereby transport policy throughout Europe accepts the continued state financing of roadway and railway infrastructure but not seaway infrastructure. It is argued in this context that the seaway-equivalent infrastructure of roadways and railways is the deck of a ship. This argument is convincing for a number of reasons, not least because it is relatively easily demonstrated that the sea itself is anything but a free highway (if indeed it is a highway at all), whereas ports simply act as nodes, not as transport platforms. Acknowledgement of what actually comprises seaway infrastructure could have far reaching implications for the future attractiveness and competitiveness of maritime transport vis-à-vis subsidized land transport alternatives in Europe, and should result in more adequate policy mechanisms being introduced to help overcome market distortions and ensure a level playing field between sea and land transport.},

abstract={Intermodal (IM) trains are typically the fastest freight trains operated in North America. The aerodynamic characteristics of many of these trains are often relatively poor resulting in high fuel consumption. However, considerable variation in fuel efficiency is possible depending on how the loads are placed on railcars in the train. Consequently, substantial potential fuel savings are possible if more attention is paid to the loading configuration of trains. A wayside machine vision (MV) system was developed to automatically scan passing IM trains and assess their aerodynamic efficiency. MV algorithms are used to analyse these images, detect and measure gaps between loads. In order to make use of the data, a scoring system was developed based on two attributes - the aerodynamic coefficient and slot efficiency. The aerodynamic coefficient is calculated using the Aerodynamic Subroutine of the train energy model. Slot efficiency represents the difference between the actual and ideal loading configuration given the particular set of railcars in the train. This system can provide IM terminal managers feedback on loading performance for trains and be integrated into the software support systems used for loading assignment. © IMechE 2007.},

abstract={This paper presents an energy and environmental network analysis model to explore tradeoffs associated with freight transport. The geospatial model uses an intermodal network built by the authors to connect various modes (rail, road, water) via intermodal terminals. Routes along the network are characterized not only by temporal and distance attributes, but also by cost, energy, and emissions attributes (including emissions of carbon dioxide, particulate matter, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds, and oxides of nitrogen). Decision-makers can use the model to explore tradeoffs among alternative route selection across different modal combinations, and to identify optimal routes for objectives that feature energy and environmental parameters (e.g., minimize carbon dioxide emissions). The model is demonstrated with three case studies of freight transport along the U.S. eastern seaboard. Copyright 2008 Air & Waste Management Association.},

abstract={Moving goods from the point of production to markets involves energy use and can have adverse environmental effects. But from the supply chain management perspective, the control of the supply chain, with short time cycles between production and sale to customer, can benefit the environment by closely tailoring production to consumption, and by minimizing the amount of "perishability" in the chain. An energy consumption model is used to explore potential tradeoffs between these two competing tendencies and applied to temperature-controlled food products produced in agricultural regions in the US with mild climates and then distributed around the country using surface transportation. Although the use of rail can reduce life cycle energy consumption compared to truck, the increase in perishability of food products can undercut the energy savings, and in some circumstances, the use of inter-modal rail can be environmentally superior to carload freight for delivery. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Reaching decisions in the process of establishment and operation of a regional transport logistics terminal performing intermodal transport and related activities should be based on the results of preliminary analysis. The selection of the appropriate location for the regional transport logistics terminal is of crucial importance as it affects directly and/or indirectly the initial financial investment, environmental and spatial issues as well as terminal operating costs and commercial sustainability. In the decision-making process regarding the location of intermodal terminals or with regard to building of a new regional intermodal terminal at a specific location a thorough transport logistics analysis should be performed. The paper presents the methodology developed for transport logistics analysis of regional intermodal transport logistics terminals, based on the sets of parameters, criteria and indicators which enable the determination of the overall performance index for a particular terminal location.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the logistics performance of intermodal freight transportation, a reasonably innovative methodology, to Thailand. Design/methodology/approach – Fuzzy set techniques are applied to assess the meaning of logistics performance within the decision process of freight operators. The fuzzy-analytical hierarchy process is applied to identify the relative significance among the attributes in the hierarchy framework levels. Consequently, the fuzzy-multi-criteria analysis is used to assess decision makers’ perception of the logistics performance via proper assignment of numerical scores. The subjective judgments for hierarchical attributes are transformed into fuzzy degrees of score. Findings – Results show a summary of performance indices for different levels in the hierarchy framework. The results demonstrate that the lack of coordination among modes limit the attractiveness of intermodal system. In addition, the methodology is proposed to examine changing variables regarding modal shift and challenge the truck dominance in Thailand. Research limitations/implications – The proposed framework is only a starting point for integrating the views of logistics operators in the analytical processes. This study did not include several external social costs such as accidents, congestion, and environmental costs. Practical implications – The methodology provides an approach lead to the index values for assessment and comparative analysis. The strengths and limitations of each alternative were benchmarked relative to a set of hierarchical attributes. Sensitivity analyses of significant variables are performed to examine the impact on changed costs and services levels. The model can entail use of corresponding parameters to improve a logistics system. Originality/value – The performance measurement is formulated from the modal choice perspective with a human decision problem. The use of logistics performance base indicators has been linked to the intermodal transport system. This study extends the newly developed methodological framework to evaluate the logistics performance of intermodal transportation. © 2008, Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics, All rights Reserved.},

abstract={Intermodal transport can reduce the load of the road infrastructure. Knowledge gives it the necessary competitiveness and helps to control its costs. Fast reaction to changing conditions, opportunities and requirements gives remarkable advantage. Setting up integrated logistic chains using alternative transport modes requires the trust and close interaction of a variety of actors involved in managing the chain. Especially in the dynamic mobile environment, knowledge has so far not been effectively used. FREIGHTWISE tackles this complexity by developing a framework architecture anchored and validated in a range of demonstration cases involving commercial and public actors. This paper discusses the general FREIGHTWISE objectives and its North-East Case, the Logistiikkainfo goods transport service network information system to be implemented for the Estonian - Finnish transport chain.},

abstract={The concept of flow has become particularly important in logistics and freight distribution. From a simple question of capacity, the issues of timing, frequency and punctuality are now of significant relevance in freight movements since they are part of supply chain management strategies. In particular, transport terminals and freight distribution centers have been the major elements permitting improvements in the efficiency and throughput of commodity chains from global production networks to local distribution. Intermodal transportation underlines a growing integration of freight transport systems brought by containerization. Receiving less attention, transshipments are not only an intermodal (flows between modes) issue, but also a transmodal (flows within the components of a mode) one. Rail transportation in North America is particularly illustrative of the challenges of transmodal operations. While containerized rail freight has experienced a substantial growth in recent years, this growth appears to be reaching serious bottlenecks, particularly at locations where transmodal operations have surged, such as Chicago. The paper investigates the concept of a "Thruport", a facility designed to handle high volume transmodal rail shipments. The Thruport offers the potential of reconciling time and flows in rail freight distribution from which significant financial, time, energy and environmental benefits can be realized. It is argued that the Thruport represents a step in the evolution of intermodal transportation and containerization for inland transport systems. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the logistics performance of intermodal freight transportation, a reasonably innovative methodology, to Thailand. Fuzzy set techniques are applied to assess the meaning of logistics performance within the decision process of freight operators. The fuzzy-analytical hierarchy process is applied to identify the relative significance among the attributes in the hierarchy framework levels. Consequently, the fuzzy-multi-criteria analysis is used to assess decision makers' perception of the logistics performance via proper assignment of numerical scores. The subjective judgments for hierarchical attributes are transformed into fuzzy degrees of score. Results show a summary of performance indices for different levels in the hierarchy framework. The results demonstrate that the lack of coordination among modes limit the attractiveness of intermodal system. In addition, the methodology is proposed to examine changing variables regarding modal shift and challenge the truck dominance in Thailand. The proposed framework is only a starting point for integrating the views of logistics operators in the analytical processes. This study did not include several external social costs such as accidents, congestion, and environmental costs. The methodology provides an approach lead to the index values for assessment and comparative analysis. The strengths and limitations of each alternative were benchmarked relative to a set of hierarchical attributes. Sensitivity analyses of significant variables are performed to examine the impact on changed costs and services levels. The model can entail use of corresponding parameters to improve a logistics system. The performance measurement is formulated from the modal choice perspective with a human decision problem.

abstract={The choice of location for an intermodal transport terminal is an important component in a regional logistics system and a paramount decision for the investor as well as the community affected. The investor needs a realistic estimation of traffic potentials and incorporated cost-estimates of a location, since it serves as an important input to the investment decision process. Policy makers need instruments and tools to analyse the effect of intermodal terminals on the surrounding environment, which also enables a comparison between several possible locations in order to ensure sustainability and long-term competitiveness. The model in this paper allows a comparative evaluation of a set of possible intermodal terminal locations based on considerations by relevant actors. Furthermore, it presents a process of retrieving data and effectively communicating results. Considerations and interests of stakeholders are incorporated into the approach by means of evaluative criteria. The approach aims at facilitating the planning process of regional logistics systems in general and the evaluation process of intermodal terminal locations in particular by considering both public and private interests focusing on economic and environmental aspects.},

abstract={Intermodal rail/road freight transport has always been considered as a competitive alternative to its road freight counterpart in the European medium- to long-distance corridors (markets). Such consideration has been based on the increasing competitiveness of some innovative rail services and the existing and prospective performance of both modes in terms of the full social - internal or operational and external - costs. The most recent innovation of rail technologies and related services launched by some European railway companies, still at the conceptual level, is the Long Intermodal Freight Train (LIFT). This is supposed to be a block train operating in long-distance corridors (markets) with a substantial and regular freight demand. This paper develops analytical models for assessing the performance of the LIFTs, the already-operating Conventional Intermodal Freight Trains (CIFTs), and their road counterpart as well. The performance consists of the full - internal (private) and external - costs of the door-to-door delivery of loading units - containers, swap-bodies, and semi-trailers. The internal costs embrace the operational costs of the transport (rail and road) and intermodal terminal operators. The external costs include the costs of the impacts of door-to-door delivery of loading units on society and the environment. These negative externalities include noise, air pollution, traffic accidents, and congestion. The models are applied to a simplified version of intermodal and road transport system using inputs from the European freight transport sector. The aims are to compare the full costs of particular modalities in order to investigate the potential of the LIFTs as compared with the CIFTs in improving the internal efficiency of the rail freight sector and its competitiveness with respect to its road counterpart. In addition, the paper attempts to assess some effects on the potential modal shift of EU (European Union) transport policies on internalizing transport externalities. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Purpose - A close dry port with direct rail connection to a seaport is a potential solution for seaport terminal congestion as well as for better seaport inland access. The purpose of this paper is to investigate and define impediments to a close advanced intermodal terminal - dry port implementation. Design/methodology/approach - Comparative case studies through face-to-face interviews and a literature review have been carried out in order to accomplish the purpose. In addition, secondary sources such as reports, internal documents and web pages were used. Findings - The most common factors that impede dry port implementation are infrastructure, land use, environment and regulations. Hence, the same reduce the efficiency of freight movements on land access routes to and from seaports. An advanced intermodal terminal must fit into a complex system where the necessary infrastructure is in place and the regulatory systems are properly designed to optimize the involvement of both the public and the private sector. Research limitations/implications - Empirical data for the case studies are collected at Port Botany, Sydney, and its close intermodal terminals. A more comprehensive view of the problem could be obtained through additional case studies on other countries' seaports' intermodal terminals. Originality/value - The idea behind the study is to contribute to a better understanding of the concept of close dry port through the factors that influence the implementation of the same and thereby to improve knowledge of the implementation of the concept. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Designing multimodal freight transport networks can facilitate the economic development of regions and countries as well as help to reduce negative environmental impacts. It is therefore crucial that such be undertaken in areas where more priority is given on road-based freight transport systems. This paper proposes a model for strategic transport planning, particularly in freight terminal development and interregional freight transport network design. The model determines a suitable set of actions from a number of possible actions, such as improving the existing infrastructure or establishing new roads, railways, sea links, and freight terminals. Modelling is undertaken within the framework of bilevel programming, where a multimodal multiclass user traffic assignment technique is incorporated within the lower-level problem, whilst the upper-level problem determines the best combination of actions such that the freight-related benefit-cost ratio is maximised. The upper-level problem involves combinatorial optimisation, and a heuristic approach based on genetic local search is applied as a solution technique. Empirical results of the model as applied to an actual large-sized interregional intermodal freight transport network show that genetic local search could provide better performance as compared to other genetic algorithm-based, as well as tabu search-based, heuristics. The model is successfully applied to transport network planning in the Philippines, where the development of a freight transport network is necessary to increase the utilisation of other modes rather than road-based vehicles. © 2009 INFORMS.},

However, its efficiency is strongly dependent on the location of the container terminals. In this paper, a set of estimated potential locations is used as input for an iterative procedure based on the p-hub median problem that takes the variation in trans-shipment costs according to the number of trans-shipped containers into account. The final results are the optimal locations for European transfer terminals embedded in a hub-and-spoke network. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={According to the mid-term review of the EU White Paper on Transport, Short Sea Shipping (SSS) is expected to grow at a rate of 59% (metric tonnes) between 2000 and 2020. If we consider that the overall expected increase in both freight exchanges and volume is 50%, sea transport is one of the most feasible alternatives to reduce traffic congestion on European roads. Maritime transportation may compete with road transport as far as certain traffics are concerned, but only when assuming external costs. This paper analyzes several intermodal transport chains involving a sea leg by comparing the effect of pollutant emissions from different ship types and road transport in terms of potential external cost savings. The translation of these emissions into environmental costs shows, for certain conditions, savings in the case of sea transport that would justify the use of an environmental bonus to promote the sea option. © 2009 World Maritime University.},

A concrete investment in ITS services and system is expected to deliver important results measurable against European safety target, congestion management goals and environmental concerns. ITS offers way of achieving key policy goals such as transfer roads, managing congestion, encouraging the use of alternative modes, promoting efficient movement of freight and contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The EC's ITS Action Plan challenges include harmonization across geographical boundaries between road administration and operators, enabling inter modal transfer and smooth access to passenger and freight interchanges and allows travelers and freight operators the optimized us of all available modes. An attainment of the interoperability between the national, regional, and local roads and across borders is expected from the EU framework of ITS Action plan.},

abstract={This article examines whether the European Commission succeeded in reducing the negative socio-environmental externalities of road transport in Northern, Central and South-eastern Europe by introducing the First Infrastructure Package and Interoperability Directive that opened rail freight markets to competition. Using results from the EC-sponsored REORIENT project, the article searches for causal links between the completeness of legislative adherence and the occurrence of market rivalry. In so doing, it draws on the New Public Management (NPM) theorem which provided conceptual underpinnings for liberalisation policy and the notion of path-dependency warning that effectiveness of any public policy is contingent on the features of its implementation context. The article contrasts the adoption of rail deregulation directives by the old and rich EU-states in the Nordic region with the newly liberated, more recent EU-members in Central and South-eastern Europe in order to expose how the political, economic and cultural features of these countries affected the quality of legislative compliance and market rivalry. This method unearthed a clearly polarised picture of inter-country compliance and competition pattern. Norway, Sweden and Finland exhibit high levels of legal adherence without however, much intra-rail competition. Cut-off from the government subsidies, these countries' state railways compete today with road operators, without however facing much rivalry from truckers. On the other hand, the new EU-members still lag on legislative conformance, but their licensing authorities granted operating permits to quite many private entrants. These carriers compete fiercely with the national incumbents, but the rail service quality they provide does not as yet threaten the dominance of truck in national freight transport. As a result, no inter-modal competition exists there. These findings indicate that liberalisation of rail freight market has not as yet reduced the road-rail imbalance in European freight markets nor curbed the negative socio-environmental externalities associated with motorised transport. Methodologically, this article exposed the analytical shortcoming of the NPM theorem and the strong empirical relevance of the path-dependency hypothesis.},

abstract={The dry port concept is based on a seaport directly connected by rail to inland intermodal terminals, where shippers can leave and/or collect standardised units as if directly at the seaport. The purpose of this paper is to present the dry port concept, to identify and categorise existing dry ports for the Port of Goteborg and to evaluate the concept from an environmental perspective. The conclusions indicate that implementation of a dry port in the seaport's hinterland enables the seaport to increase its terminal capacity; the modal shift from road to rail results in a reduced congestion at the seaport gates and its surroundings and consequently in improved inland access, as well as in a lesser environmental effect. Only two of the surveyed intermodal terminals can be categorised as simple dry ports for the Port of Goteborg. Copyright © 2009, Inderscience Publishers.},

abstract={Since the UNCTAD three generation port development model was proposed in 1990, changes in technology, working practices and the commercial environment have led to tighter and more sophisticated linkages between service providers, facilitators, operators and end customers. This was explored in more detail in the WORKPORT model which highlighted the way in which ports and the services they provide develop in an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary way. The political dimension can also play a lead role in port evolutionary paths, as the port is often seen both as a vital part of the supply chain and as a natural focus for regional development and employment initiatives. Depending on the type and form of cargo, customer requirements and other factors such as the degree to which ports are tied to a particular distribution channel varies. Ports remain convenient stockholding locations but where they have been made more responsive is in tailoring services to individual customers' needs, thus becoming more agile. The role of ports within the supply chain has taken several different forms and development paths. In the UK the early expression of port logistics was in the form of intermodal facilities linked to the railway network and with emphasis on transport rather than value addition. Inland Container Depots (ICDs) and P&O Roadways Container Logistics Containerbases are examples of these traditional and conservative forms of activity. European approaches have been somewhat different building on their advantage of high volumes and proximity to very large ports. The development of Distriparks and company specific facilities such as Districenters (Nedlloyd) are classic examples of landlord-tenant solutions often seen in continental Europe. Most recently there has been evidence of convergence between the UK and continental models. Associated British Ports (ABP), for example, launched their ABP Connect Division in 2001 aimed at offering Fourth Party Logistics services tailored to individual port customers' needs. The prospective development of large distripark-style facilities in the UK, e.g. at Hull and London Gateway, represents the latest stage in the evolutionary role of ports in the logistics chain.},

abstract={Rail-based intermodal freight transportation systems in the European Union have been regarded as being more environmental friendly than truck-only freight systems, particularly for long-distance haulage and in terms of CO2 emissions. However, to date there has been no clear comparison of CO2 emissions between different freight systems. Therefore, this paper examines whether the intermodal freight system really does emit less CO2 than their road-based counterparts. A research framework is established in which the methods and data of earlier studies are assessed. Based on a conceptualisation of intermodal and truck-only systems, the semi-life cycle assessment technique, which excludes emissions from infrastructure and vehicle manufacturing and includes emissions from the production of fuel and direct emissions, is used in order to examine the short- and medium-term environmental impact of different freight systems. The main conclusion is that in general rail-based intermodal freight systems emit less CO2 than truck-only systems, regardless of the type of locomotive. For electric locomotives, the electricity power-generating source is the definitive factor in deciding which type of train in an intermodal freight system offers the most environmental friendly alternative: if power plants use only coal or oil fuel sources, intermodal systems using electric trains could emit more CO2 than their competitors. © 2009 Taylor &amp; Francis.},

abstract={The dry port concept is based on a seaport directly connected by rail with inland intermodal terminals where containers can be dealt with in the same way as if they were in a seaport. The main purpose of the article is to extend the theory behind the dry port concept and to define three dry port categories; distant, midrange and close. The findings show that the dry port concept can help identify ways of shifting freight volumes from road to more energy efficient traffic modes that are less harmful to the environment, relieve seaport cities from some congestion and facilitate improved logistics solutions for shippers in the port's hinterland. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Background, aim, and scope: According to some recent studies, noise from road transport is estimated to cause human health effects of the same order of magnitude as the sum of all other emissions from the transport life cycle. Thus, ISO 14′040 implies that traffic noise effects should be considered in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies where transports might play an important role. So far, five methods for the inclusion of noise in LCA have been proposed. However, at present, none of them is implemented in any of the major life cycle inventory (LCI) databases and commonly used in LCA studies. The goal of the present paper is to define a requirement profile for a method to include traffic noise in LCA and to assess the compliance of the five existing methods with this profile. It concludes by identifying necessary cornerstones for a model for noise effects of generic road transports that meets all requirements. Materials and methods: Requirements for a methodological framework for inclusion of traffic noise effects in LCA are derived from an analysis of how transports are included in 66 case studies published in International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment in 2006 and 2007, in the sustainability reports of ten Swiss companies, as well as on the basis of theoretical considerations. Then, the general compliance of the five existing methods for inclusion of noise in LCA with the postulated requirement profile is assessed. Results: Six general requirements for a methodological framework for inclusion of traffic noise effects in LCA were identified. A method needs to be applicable for (1) both generic and specific transports, (2) different modes of transport, (3) different vehicles within one mode of transport, (4) transports in different geographic contexts, (5) different temporal contexts, and (6) last but not least, the method needs to be compatible with the ISO standards on LCA. One of the reviewed methods is not specific for transports at all and two are only applicable for specific transports. The other two allow generic and specific road transports to be assessed. The methods either deal with road traffic noise only or they compare noise from different sources, ignoring the fact that not only physical sound levels but also the source of sound determines the effect. Three methods only differentiate between vehicle classes (lorries and passenger cars) while one method differentiates between specific vehicles of the same class. Four of the methods consider the geographic context and three of them differentiate between day- and nighttime traffic. Discussion: None of the existing methods for traffic noise integration in LCA complies with the proposed requirement profile. They either lack the genericness for a wide application or they lack the specificity needed for differentiations in LCA studies. There is no method available that allows for appropriate inter- or intramodal comparison of traffic noise effects. Thus, the benefit of the existing methods is limited. They can, in the better cases, only demonstrate the relative importance of road or rail traffic noise effects compared to the nonnoise-related effects of transportation. Conclusions: Currently, none of the major LCI databases includes traffic noise indicators. Thus, noise effects are usually not considered in LCA studies. We introduce a requirement profile for methods that allow the inclusion of noise in LCI. Due to the estimated significance of noise in transport LCA, this inclusion will change the overall results of many LCA studies. None of the existing methods fully complies with the requirement profile. Two of the methods can be modified and extended for inclusion in generic LCI databases. A third model allows for intermodal comparison. From an LCA perspective, all methods include weaknesses and need to be amended in order to make them widely usable. Recommendations and perspectives: In part 2 of this paper, an in-depth analysis of the promising methods is provided, improvement potential is evaluated, and a new context-sensitive framework for the consistent LCI modeling of noise emissions from road transportation is presented. Appropriate methods for modeling rail and air traffic noise will have to be developed in the future in order to arrive at a methodological framework fully compliant with the requirement profile. Furthermore, future research is needed to identify appropriate methods for impact assessment. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to consider the use of temporary storage offered by intermodal transshipment points to position some stock of fast moving consumer goods in advance of demand; this floating stock concept combines transport and inventory management. Intermodal transport is compared with direct road transport for a supply chain. Design/methodology/approach – First an analytical comparison is made which shows that the floating stock concept has advantages in inventories over pure road and intermodal transport. Next, a simulation study of a real case is made which quantifies the costdifferences in detail. Findings – It is found that both storage costs can be lowered and shorter response times be gotten by sending shipments in advance to intermodal terminals. The advance positioning can offset the disadvantage of a longer transit time in intermodal transport. Research limitations/implications – Demand needs to be somewhat predictable. The pooling effects depend on geographical layout of the customers. The availability of intermodal transport options is based on the situation in Western Europe. Practical implications – The floating stock concept considers both the transport and inventory issues. By positioning some of the stock at transshipment points close to the customer in anticipation of demand, the concept can yield lower inventory costs as well as a lower customer lead time. The benefit for logistics service providers is a more regular supply chain. Using intermodal transport provides an opportunity to green the supply chain as the environmental impact per ton/kilometer is lower than road transport. Originality/value – This paper draws on the areas of logistics and inventory management to consider the choice of transport mode; most studies look at these issues in isolation. Considering the holding and storage costs in addition to the distribution strategy enables a more thorough comparison of the transport modes. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={The transit industry in the United States is preparing for growth as the world deals with climate change and it is applying various methods to measure and monitor its impact on the environment. Working with local, state, and federal governments, transit agencies have adapted many commonsense solutions. Now the American Public Transportation Association is putting together standards and best practices to encourage the industry and inform the public about the benefits ofpublic transportation to the environment, helping our nation join the rest ofthe world. It is also developing and applying new transit strategies that will attract more riders and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Portland, Oregon's Tri-Met, New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and the Utah Transit Authority are leading the industry. Portland, Oregon's Tri-Met General Manager, who chairs the industry's Sustainability Committee for the American Public Transit Association has been leading by example with an Environmental Management System that addresses greenhouse gas, pollution, waste, inefficiency, and congestion. New York and Utah are recording greenhouse gases with the Climate Registry. Many agencies are developing new strategies that are attracting more riders and experiencing an intermodal shift to buses and trains.

abstract={Intermodal transport is the combination and integration of several transport modes (such as rail, inland waterways with road transport). In order to make the transhipment easy and efficient standard loading units are used, such as containers or swap-bodies. As for the main haul, more environmental friendly modes are used (rail and inland waterways) and a modal shift towards these modes can help in reducing the congestion. Therefore several policies are directed to stimulate the intermodal transport market. In this paper, a location analysis model for Belgian intermodal terminals (LAMBIT) is developed and used to assess different policy measures in Belgium. The simulations show that the different policy measures oriented towards the rail/road and inland waterways/road combinations should be incorporated in a coherent, integrated vision, in order to not create a modal shift between the different intermodal transport options. The methodology can easily be extended towards a European scale. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The waste intermodal station of Clyde, in the city of Sydney, Australia, is in the heart of a complex network of terminals connected by road and rail to transport urban waste from its first collection to its final disposal. The amount of waste the network is projected to handle in 2015 will increase from about 340,000 tonnes/year in 2006 up to about 1.5 million tonnes/year, following population and consumption raise. The paper proposes a discrete-event model to represent Clyde Transfer Station (TS) and its relations with the other terminals. Such a model allows one to evaluate the effects of different expansion plans of the station structures as well as different policies of the collection service. The results show that, as often happens, a careful consideration of management alternatives can decrease the necessity of structural enlargement, which is normally much more expensive, if at all possible. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to define a theoretical model to stimulate intermodal transport in the Adriatic region in terms of sustainable development. A research has presented four basic activities (elements, factors), each solving the existing problems that complicate and slow the functioning and development of intermodal transport in the Adriatic region. In addition, the result shows that each of these activities of the presented model can be implemented independently in every country, but the full effect is achieved only when all the countries in the region are involved. The methodology which was used in forming the theoretic model has been designed on the basis of Logistic Freight Transport Action Plan (COM (2007) 607) by introducing information technology and quality management in intermodal transport system, initiating regional promotion and implementation of bottleneck exercise project. The results of the implementation of the presented model are: increase of the "modal shift" form road to sea, railways and inland waterways, positive environmental impact, creation of institutional and expert network and, finally, development or regional economy.},

The geospatial model integrates U.S. and Canadian highway, rail, and waterway networks to create an intermodal network and characterizes this network using temporal, economic, and environmental attributes (including emissions of carbon dioxide, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds, and nitrogen oxides). A case study evaluates tradeoffs associated with containerized traffic flow in the Great Lakes region, demonstrating how choice of freight mode affects the environmental performance of movement of goods. These results suggest opportunities to improve the environmental performance of freight transport through infrastructure development, technology implementation, and economic incentives.

abstract={To ensure better regulation, the emergence of Support Systems Operations (SSO) had helped the regulators. SSO allow real-time monitoring of operating a urban transport network. We consider the problem of matching supply with actual operating conditions. To do this, we propose a system for decision support that provides traffic monitoring, incident detection, diagnosis and control. This system uses two concepts of artificial intelligence: The multi-agent systems and the anytime approach. We present a model of multi-agent decision support in real time. We rely on a new approach based on progressive reasoning, to take into account real-time in a MAS: the proposed model is called SMAST (Multi-Agent System for Modeling Transport Systems). It provides users a rich environment for modeling tools and techniques according to the Geographic Information Systems GIS. Algiers city was taken as a study case. It is a very complex case for intermodal synchronization, because it includes various modes of transport. (Bus, urban train, metro, tram). © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.},

abstract={Imperatives to improve the sustainability of cities often hinge upon plans to increase urban residential density to facilitate greater reliance on sustainable forms of transport and minimise car use. However there is on going debate about whether high residential density land use in isolation results in sustainable transport outcomes. Findings from surveys with residents of inner-urban high density dwellings in Brisbane, Australia, suggest that solo car travel accounts for the greatest modal share of typical work journeys and attitudes toward dwelling and neighbourhood transport-related features, residential sorting factors and socio-demographics, alongside land use such as public transport availability, are significantly associated with work travel mode choice. We discuss the implications of our findings for transport policy and management including encouraging relatively sustainable intermodal forms of transport for work journeys.

abstract={The dominance of road for hinterland services could be challenged by using rail-road or waterway-road transport because of costs, congestion and growing environmental constraints. A common dynamic that is very favorable to the development of combined transport is shared among the actors of the transport chain but with different starting positions considering the ports of the Northern Range.But combined transport must still demonstrate that it can compete with road transport. Road transport and combined transport are not directly comparable because they do not offer the same physical transport service. The organizational patterns of road and combined transport are investigated. The example of hinterland services to and from the port of Le Havre to the Paris region is a particularly interesting case because of the very short distance. It is shown that the competitiveness of combined transport in terms of price varies greatly according to the way road transport it competes with is organized and that the commercial policy of combined transport operators plays a key role for explaining this competitiveness. Additional services such as additional dwelling times and specific custom advantages are paramount of importance to encourage the shift from road transport to combined transport. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In the present competitive environment of ports, the key determinant in port competition is the ability of a port to be integrated into the local maritime and hinterland transportation chain. Creating effective integrated hinterland chains requires the coordination of several actors both in port and the hinterland. By making use of insights from Transaction Cost Economics and Resource-based View, the paper helps to understand why and how shipping lines and terminal operating companies enlarge their scope in intermodal transport and in inland terminals. The paper discusses a number of cases from the Hamburg-Le Havre range, where shipping lines and terminal operating companies have changed their scope of activities in ports and hinterland networks. After the theoretical and empirical analysis the papers draws conclusions on the explanatory power of the theories in understanding hinterland service integration by shipping lines and terminal operators. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This paper presents the impact of fuel price increases on the market area of intermodal transport terminals. Aim of this research is to determine whether an increase in fuel prices is sufficient enough to raise the market area of intermodal transport to the same degree that would be accomplished by stimulating intermodal transport through policy instruments. Therefore, several fuel price scenarios are analysed in order to verify the impact of different fuel price evolutions on the market area of unimodal road transport compared to intermodal transport in Belgium. The LAMBIT-model (Location Analysis for Belgian Intermodal Terminals), which is a GIS-based model (Macharis and Pekin, 2008), is used to analyse the different fuel price increases and enables a visualisation of the impact on the market area. The LAMBIT model incorporates the different network layers for each transport mode by setting up a GIS network that includes four different layers: the road network, the rail network, the inland waterways network and the final haulage network. The geographic locations of the intermodal terminals and the port of Antwerp are added as nodes in the network and the Belgian municipality centres are defined and connected to the different network layers. Based on the different fuel price scenarios representing respectively a fuel price increase with 10% (low price case), 50% (business as usual case) and 90% (high price case), the results of the LAMBIT model show that the market areas rise in favour of intermodal barge/road and intermodal rail/road. Depending on the scenario, the degree of modal shift however differs. Additionally, in order to compare policy measures with the effect of a fuel price increase, the internalisation of the external costs is analysed with the LAMBIT model. For some years, the European Commission is supporting the idea that transportation costs should reflect the true impacts on environment and society, and is relentlessly pushing towards the so called 'internalisation of external costs' as a policy instrument in order to establish fair and efficient pricing of different transport modes. This requires monetarizing the external effects of transport and adding them to the already internalized costs in order to give the correct price signals. Results of this comparative analysis performed with the LAMBIT model are also presented in this paper. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This paper looks at the role and importance of regional airports in mountain areas. The question of accessibility is examined at different scales, from regional airports serving mountain areas to high-altitude aerodromes (altiports) and airstrips (altisurfaces) in mountain resorts. The ways in which air transport is integrated into intermodal transport systems serving tourist areas, most notably mountain resorts, are also investigated. Given the highly seasonal and specific nature of their use, many airports serving mountain areas are faced with problems of over-sizing or seasonal congestion. Issues such as the socio-economic and environmental integration of regional airports are also extremely important for mountain areas. Altiports and altisurfaces can contribute substantially to the tourism development of mountain regions by improving accessibility for visitors and through leisure aviation. Consequently, regional airports have a substantial impact on an area's image, whether they are viewed positively, as an aid to development, or negatively, as harmful to the environment. The present analysis was based on several case studies that highlight different aspects of regional air transport in mountain areas. The specificities of regional airport development in the Alps, and particularly in France, are illustrated by the story of Air Alpes. Attention is also focused on the links between the United Kingdom and Chambéry and Grenoble airports, which are dominated by low-cost airlines. Looking at the larger picture, examples of mountain-periphery and extra-mountain airports in France, Switzerland and Nepal are examined in order to investigate the formation of networks, the importance of regional airports and their contribution to regional development. © 2010 WIT Press.},

abstract={The idea of using transit-oriented development (TOD) in reducing automobile dependency and improving the sustainability of transportation activities has gained wider support in recent years. Research findings have shown that residents living in TOD neighborhood used transit more frequently than people having similar socio-economic characteristics but living elsewhere. Most of the existing studies on TOD and transit ridership used recently developed sites or suburban neighborhoods as case studies. However, limited research studies have been conducted on TOD using city-wide station-level data. By using the heavy rail systems in New York City and Hong Kong as case studies, factors which are expected to contribute to higher rail transit ridership are analyzed by using multiple regressions. The results show that a combination of variables in different dimensions, including (i) land use, (ii) station characteristics, (iii) socio-economic and demographic characteristics and (iv) inter-modal competition were important in accounting for the variability of rail transit ridership. In particular, station characteristics appeared to be the most important dimension in affecting average weekday railway patronage. Future research on TOD may pay more attention on examining how various aspects of station characteristics can be modified to increase railway patronage. Besides, car ownership is both significant and positively associated with railway patronage. The result suggests that higher car ownership may be associated with more pick-ups, drop-offs and park-and-ride activities to the transit stations for the longer transit trip legs. Furthermore, this study shows that place-specific factors are important in influencing railway patronage. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The UK's newly-launched five-member Efficient Reliable Transportation of Consignments (ERTOC) initiative aims at making goods movement more intelligent and intermodal by increasing awareness of its true financial and environmental costs. Supported by the Technology Strategy Board under its Collaborative R&D Funding Program, the two-year, £3 million initiative is developing a new, standards-based, open-architecture data hub for the industry. Its role will be to collect, fuse, and intelligently store data from on-vehicle systems for use in off-vehicle applications. ERTOC plans to take advantage of ITS-derived material to fill a critical information gap. Assessments of the environmental impact of transport, as of other contributors to climate change, is currently heavily dependent on proxy data, from sources including the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), and vehicle manufacturers' indicative performance tables. The launch of the UK'S Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) Energy Efficiency Scheme from April 1, 2010 has led to ERTOC.},

abstract={International airports are among the few examples of transport infrastructures which can well achieve self-financing. The growing interest of private companies in airport construction and operation is the visible testimony to this fact. However, the financing structures of airports are complex, involving not only traffic, passenger and goods handling, but also non-aviation services, such as retail, car parking or intermodal facilities. The integration of social marginal cost pricing schemes into this organizational structure according to the strategic plans of the European Commission, however, is challenging. This paper investigates whether they comply with a second strategic policy objective at European and national level, which is to foster public-private partnerships (PPPs) in transport financing in terms of full cost coverage, risks and incentives.The cases analysed in this paper deal with two sites with very different characteristics: Munich Airport which has been publicly operated since 1991 and the Bulgarian airports Varna and Burgas, which have been managed since 2007 by one concessionaire and whose planning and future development is being accomplished with private capital. The results of both cases showed that self-financing is possible in case congestion costs are considered in the SMCP schemes, and given that air traffic growth rates return to the significant levels prior to the economic crisis. The chapter will discuss the legal implications of congestion pricing at European airports which are violating current EC legislation, as well as the impact of alternative pricing schemes on the environmental performance and technological innovation in aviation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The continuous growth of the urban traffic threats cities with "thrombosis", generating social, economic and ecological long term problems. The paper outlines the positive externalities induced by the non-motorized transportation (walking, bicycling or small-wheeled transport) at individual, social and environmental level. This kind of transportation meets the requests of the urban sustainable development, being used stand-alone or as a part of an intermodal chain. Local authorities, education institutes, corporate and non-governmental organizations should be involved in challenging perceptions and attitudes toward non-motorized trips. Beside the infrastructure construction, the early education is mandatory for creating a civic culture regarding the use of non-motorized transportation. The case study in Bucharest shows out the present state concerning the use of non-motorized transportation and the barriers in using it.},

abstract={Considering the great environmental awakenings at the planetary level and the discounted growth of the carriage of goods per transportation mode in the world, the distribution and haulage companies must start to take measures to limit their impacts. The goal of this paper is to model the performance of an intermodal transportation system within the green supply chain, taking into account the economic, environmental and societal criteria in order to help decision-makers in choosing the path with the best compromised benefit/impacts in an intermodal transportation system. We have to trade with many conflicting criteria, it is thus appropriate to use multicriteria decision support system to find the best compromised solution. The path selection in a multimodal transportation network is therefore a multicriteria decision-making problem. In this paper, we will use an approach based on the elimination and choice expressing the reality (ELECTRE) method to solve our multicriteria model. © Copyright 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={An intermodal hub can be defined as a place where transportation networks are organized to facilitate intermodality between different modes. Intermodal hubs should intrinsically have an urban dimension and be globally designed as "plug flows", being interfaces between transport networks and territory, being an element to create "urbanity". Intermodal hubs focus technical, social, urban, transport, service aspects and they play a multi-modal, multi-service, multioperator role. Several studies highlight the need to "measure the interdependence" among the various aspects of urban problems, avoiding too specific methodologies. The increasing congestion in urban centres and urban parking problems encourage mobility managers to increase "exchange poles" for the interconnection between private and public transport to out of city centres. Several authors consider the "exchange poles" as planned around three roles: "transport", "urban" and "service" function. The first is considered for the articulation of networks, the second through the integration of its close environment and the "service" for association with the movement of travellers and the information. These poles are located in large open areas, away from downtowns, easing the separation of city spaces and the concentration of desire lines, but it limits the urban inclusion of these important poles. Primarily, these nodes are scheduled to organize and ease the matching between bus lines, helping the expansion of the transport networks, to become a preferred entry point for the users. In addition, they must be places that fit the urban context with architectural quality and design, taking into account the surrounding environment. Finally, the improvement of information and users' comfort should be considered developing commercial actions to integrate urban entertainment. © 2012 WIT Press.},

abstract={The increase in traffic, freight and passengers has led to an overload of road routes that were no longer able to absorb the growing amount of traffic, and this resulted in unexpected problems related to traffic jams, increased costs and environmental pollution. It was very important to find a suitable alternative that would fully meet all users' criteria and would be able to follow current and future economic expansions, increase in trade and population growth. As a possible solution, the European Union proposed a program of short sea shipping connections, which represents a certain type of innovation. Its aim is to unburden the overloaded road routes and offer sea routes as an alternative. On its path of development the implementation of the program meets many obstacles. Firstly, it is necessary to identify these obstacles, and then to remove them, in order to enable faster and better progress. Therefore, this paper gives a special attention to identifying obstacles that impede the implementation of short sea shipping connection in developed countries of the European Union, and also in the Republic of Croatia. The paper also presents a part of the 'Motorways of the Sea' program, which refers to the introduction of a new intermodal logistics chain, based on ship transport, which should bring structural changes into the organization of European transport. Thus allow for successful functioning of the short sea shipping connections and overcoming the obstacles which impede its implementation.},

Transport modes performance evaluation is an important topic of that aspect. In this paper, with time window, transport capacity constraints and especially external transaction costs considered, a 0-1 mixed integer programming model is developed to solve the problem of transport modes selection for defined staging transportation networks. A hybrid genetic algorithm is adopted to find the numerical solution of the model. A case study is presented to demonstrate how the developed model can be used to solve practical problems.

abstract={The long-term growth in the volume of international trade poses considerable economic and sustainability challenges for freight transport, not least for the landward movement of deep sea containers. Rail freight plays a major role in the inland transport of containers passing through the main British container ports, and potentially could play a more significant role in the future. However, there is little detailed understanding of the nature of this particular rail market, especially in terms its current operating efficiency. To improve knowledge in this area, the paper focuses specifically on an analysis of container train service provision and load factors to/from the four main ports, based on a representative survey in 2007 of almost 600 container trains. The extent to which the existing capacity is utilised is presented, and scenarios by which the number of containers carried could be increased without requiring additional train service provision are modelled, to identify the theoretical potential for greater rail volumes. Substantial existing spare capacity was evident, with considerable variability by port and rail freight operator. If all existing services were fully loaded, a 38 per cent increase in container traffic by rail would result and if all services were operated with 24 fully loaded standard wagons, there would be 65 per cent growth. Finally, the paper identifies the challenges involved in achieving higher load factors, emphasising the importance both of wider supply chain considerations and government policy decision-making.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of optimally locating intermodal freight terminals in Serbia. To solve this problem and determine the effects of the resulting scenarios, two modeling approaches were combined. The first approach is based on multiple-assignment hub-network design, and the second is based on simulation. The multiple-assignment p-hub network location model was used to determine the optimal location of intermodal terminals. Simulation was used as a tool to estimate intermodal transport flow volumes, due to the unreliability and unavailability of specific statistical data, and as a method for quantitatively analyzing the economic, time, and environmental effects of different scenarios of intermodal terminal development. The results presented here represent a summary, with some extension, of the research realized in the IMOD-X project (Intermodal Solutions for Competitive Transport in Serbia). © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The volume of international trade and freight transport in Asia has witnessed fast growth in recent decades. The resulting environmental impact of freight transport operations has become a major cause of concern. Intermodal transport has gained prominence recently due to its potential to offer door-to-door service through the integration of various modes of transport in the logistics chain, improved coordination and services, and the development of intermodal interfaces. However, few studies have focused on this development in Asia.The development of intermodal transport requires transport links, nodes, and services. The development of dry ports, an important component of intermodal transport, could play a major role in promoting intermodal transport in Asia, including its twelve landlocked countries. Dry ports located in deep inland areas, as opposed to near the sea, would incorporate customs and other related facilities and rail links, as well as provide for transfer, transshipment, and distribution functions for cargo. By encouraging a modal shift, such dry ports would help to ease road traffic congestion and reduce emissions.This study reviews the status of intermodal freight transport in Asia from an environmental perspective. It examines intermodal transport opportunities presented by the development of inland dry ports in hinterland locations. This paper also reviews selected case studies of dry port development in Asia. Finally, we present the lessons to be learned for the promotion of intermodal freight transport from selected Asian countries as well as the policy options available. © 2011 International Association of Traffic and Safety Sciences.},

abstract={Estimates of fuel use and air pollutant emissions from freight rail currently rely highly on aggregate methods and largely obsolete data which offer little insight into contemporary air quality problems. Because the freight industry is for the most part privately held and data are closely guarded for competitive reasons, the challenge is to produce robust estimates using current reporting requirements, while accurately portraying the spatial nature of freight rail impacts.This research presents a new spatially resolved model for estimating air pollutant emissions (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter less than 10 μm in diameter, sulfur dioxide, and carbon dioxide) from locomotives. Emission estimates are based on track segment level data including track grade, type of train traffic (bulk, intermodal, or manifest) and the local locomotive fleet (EPA tier certification level and fuel efficiency). We model the California Class I freight rail system and compare our results to regional estimates from the California Air Resources Board and to estimates following U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidance. We find that our results vary considerably from the other methods depending on the region or corridor analyzed. We also find large differences in fuel and emission intensity for individual rail corridors. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={In Thailand, transport sector is the largest energy consuming sector (38%). Road haulage of freight transport accounts for approximately 92% of total domestic freight movements. Accordingly, it is one of the largest contributors to adverse environmental impacts. This study presents one option to reduce energy consumption through modal shift from trailer to intermodal transport involving railway and waterway. It focuses on freight movements between Bangkok and Hat Yai in Thailand. Energy savings are measured by multi-objective optimisation model using decision variables consisting of three mode options: trailer only, intermodal-rail and intermodal-waterway. In addition to energy consumption, the objective function also includes time and charge of shipment factor. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Decreasing environmental emissions originated from transportation sector plays a big role in the strategies of EU. One way to decrease emissions is to shift freight transport from unimodal road transport to intermodal solutions. Dry port concept aims at increasing rail transport between seaports and inland intermodal terminals, which are called dry ports. Such a concept is in infancy in Finnish transportation network. The main transport mode used in Finland is unimodal road transport. The aim of this research is to study the effects of a hypothetical dry port structure in Finnish transportation network. The effects are researched with different gravitational models. They apply linear integer programming, and heuristics to find relative transport costs in each situation. Differences in road and rail network, and road and rail transport modes are taken into account. The results of the models argue that Finland could benefit from dry port network. Cost-efficiency of the Finnish transportation network could be enhanced by using up to five or six dry ports. In addition, by replacing road transport with rail transport the environmental impacts can be lowered considerably. However, by alternatively utilizing within wider scale dense seaport network of Finland, we could achieve even better environmental results - approach which has been neglected so far in the dry port literature.},

abstract={Increasingly air transport growth raises the question of its impact on the environment. Public authorities and researchers are relying more and more on high-speed trains (HSTs), whose efficiency is supposed to lead to a modal shift from airplanes. However, most transport studies focus on the evolution of demand rather than supply, although it is basically the latter that determines environmental damage. In light of this fact, this paper aims to compare the overall dynamics in the supply of air transport in Europe compared to the HST supply and to examine empirically five city-pairs. The development of high-speed rail remains limited compared to the increase of air services. For a given city-pair, the decline in the number of flights depends on various conditions, including length of the HST journey and the strategies adopted by the airlines. Some carriers reduce their supply in terms of the number of seats but increase the number of flights in order to compete more effectively with the HSTs. Moreover, the competition between low-cost airlines and HSTs should be kept in mind and re-examined in a few years. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: In recent years intermodal transport has received an increased attention due to problems of road congestion, environmental concerns and traffic safety. A growing recognition of the external effects of transport urges to go towards more sustainable transport modes. As a consequence, research and policy interest in intermodal freight transportation problems is growing. Methods: In this paper the strengths of Operations Research (OR) modelling techniques applicable to decisions related to intermodal transport are used to develop a particular framework that is able to assess the performance of current and potential policy measures which affects the intermodal transport industry. The assessment framework includes three core models necessary to evaluate all relevant transport modes and aggregation levels. Results: In the last section of the paper, the assessment framework is applied to a case study related to the location of a new intermodal barge terminal for which the optimal location is searched, the market area is analysed and the impact on the performance of the network is discussed. © 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract={Environmental problems are becoming worse, and increase in the movement of people is also causing concerns. However, the change of transport activities is slow, the unnecessary use of cars has not adequately decreased and the optimum conditions of transport activities are not satisfied from a viewpoint of mobility and accessibility. An intermodal transport policy for highway buses and city railroads is necessary to effectively use the social infrastructures in neighboring cities where various transportation options exist. We must change from cars to use of public transit. However, the convenience of transfer to highway buses and city railroads can not be clearly incorporated. In this study, to plan and perform an intermodal transport policy in regional public transportation planning, we quantitatively verified the intermodal transport policy for the construction of a transportation network system connecting the highway and the city railroads in neighboring cities at the planning stage. Specifically, we investigated the various factors affecting the transport activities of the inhabitants of Kameoka in Kyoto Prefecture, Japan along the Kyoto Jyukan Highway. A questionnaire based on this area was used to analyze the transport activities of the inhabitants and their consciousness about the intermodal transport policy. We constructed a traffic choice model based on an intermodal transport policy that connects highway buses and city railroads (Park and Bus Rail Ride) to the present transport system and estimated the shift in transport activities with a new traffic mode in this area. In addition, we also conducted a resident questionnaire on issues such as parking, railroads, and buses to clarify the incentives used in the selection of mode of transportation. The results of this evaluation confirm the importance of intermodal frames and help to clarify the impact of the traffic behavior of people.},

abstract={Problem: The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) gave metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) the opportunity to spend federal funds on pedestrian and bicycle facilities. Their responses vary dramatically, however, contributing to significant differences in the quality of the walking and bicycling environment across regions. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to identify factors that explain differences in the spending of federal funds for bicycle and pedestrian projects across MPOs. In addition, we consider whether federal support for bicycle and pedestrian projects has led to increased attention to these modes within the transportation planning process. With the next federal transportation authorization bill now under consideration, understanding the efficacy of federal funding for nonmotorized modes is of critical importance. Methods: This article explores these questions through case studies of bicycle and pedestrian spending and policies in six metropolitan regions. Results and Conclusions: Making federal funding available for nonmotorized modes has clearly increased bicycle and pedestrian projects across the United States, although more so in some regions than others. Support from local governments and advocacy groups is a key driver of MPO-level support for bicycle and pedestrian investments. State policy also plays a role in encouraging and supporting bicycle and pedestrian spending at the regional level, both directly and through its influence on local governments. Other unique regional factors have also influenced spending. Takeaway for Practice: Although the effectiveness of federal funding for bicycle and pedestrian projects has so far depended on state policy and local support, the next federal transportation authorization bill offers an opportunity to reduce this dependence. If the intent of the federal government is to increase spending on bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, it can provide more direction and stronger leadership in promoting nonmotorized modes. © American Planning Association, Chicago, IL.},

abstract={This article describes the trend towards European green initiatives in the transport sector. The introduction of green logistics management and green policy in Europe has been analysed to understand better the positive impact of green policy on environment, society and economy. With the most recent EU initiatives in the field of green logistics, intermodality has become the platform for green logistics development in the EU. This stimulated a complete study of the case of South East Europe. The perspective of intermodal infrastructure development, the use of intermodality and the environmental impact of the transport sector has been analysed to build an appropriate model for a macro green logistics strategy for South East Europe, where Green transport corridors should be exposed as the main goal. In our proposal of a seven-pillar strategy, all parties, including governmental institutions, manufacturing industry and logistics operators, should take an active part, enabling industry to co-create a macro transport development in the region and to influence future legislation of green issues in the transport sector, with an aim to establish Green transport corridors till 2020. There is a strong need to regulate green logistics issues in the region of South East Europe; therefore, additional studies and proposals will be necessary in the future.

abstract={This paper discusses the benefits of using short seashipping in intermodal transport for fruit and vegetables.Multi-Criteria Decision Making techniques are applied to determine optimal allocation between land and intermodal transport,including environmental externalities. A sensitivity analysis is also carried out to monitor changing priorities among decision-makers(exporters)soastoencouragea modal shift.The results reveal savings in intermodal transport costs and as light reduction in externalities with respect to land transport. However,the exporter must assume an increased delivery time ofgoods.Atpresent,this situation is farfromareality,highlighting how inherently complicated it is to change the modes of transport. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Methods have been developed to measure in situ the dynamic impact of both road and rail vehicles on the infrastructure and the environment. The resulting data sets have been analysed to quantify the environmental impacts in a transparent manner across both modes. A primary concern is that a small number of vehicles are being operated outside safe or regulatory limits which can have a disproportionate large impact. The analysis enables the various impacts to be ranked across both modes so enabling one to discern the benefits of intermodal transport. The impact of various policy options is considered and how to identify vehicles which can be classified as environmentally friendly. This would require European agreement as many heavy goods vehicle operate across country borders. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: A commonly suggested measure to make logistics greener is a shift to intermodal road-rail transportation. Most research addresses the issue from the carrier's perspective, arguing for ways to improve the service production to better fit the shippers' demand. In this article the issue is addressed from the shipper's perspective. The purpose is to understand what contextual factors and operations changes that are possible and/or necessary for the shipper to make a fit to the current production system. Design/methodology/approach: Six case companies selling non-bulk, fast moving goods are examined. These firms have gone against the mainstream and shifted modes of transport. They are investigated through a multiple case-study design. Findings: The findings indicate that contextual factors stressed in the carrier-focused literature, or rule of thumb decisions made by shipping logistics management, do not always clearly predict the success of a modal shift. However, some common denominators emerge among successful cases: large transport purchasing resources, high general carrier performance, low demand volatility, and centralized system control. The study also poses some propositions regarding the success of a modal shift. Research limitations/implications: The research is qualitative in nature and thus limited to the companies and their respective logistics systems. However, the models could be further evaluated empirically through quantitative and qualitative methods alike. Practical implications: The paper poses a number of propositions of what constitutes a successful modal shift from a shipper's perspective, based on the identified factors and operational changes. Originality/value: Previous research on the shift to intermodal road-rail solutions are predominantly made from a carrier's perspective. This research addresses the issue from the shipper's perspective. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={One serious problem seaports face today is the lack of space at maritime terminals and the growing congestion on their access routes with the inland connections. Moreover, environmental factors, regulation plans and topological constraints often prevent maritime terminal expansions. Therefore, it is now generally accepted that a strategic choice related to maritime terminals is a "dry port" policy, especially when terminals are located in urban and suburban areas, characterized by heavy commercial traffic. In this work, we deal with the evaluation of possible locations for freight modal terminals with the aim of reducing the impact of containers transport on urban mobility. In particular, we use classical simple plant location algorithms for determining optimal sites on a connected intermodal network, where arc weights refer to costs arising from the transport of standardised units via different modalities. We focus our analysis on the logistic network in the Italian north-western regions, taking into a proper account the needs of the seaport network of the Liguria County and the most congested nodes in the transportation network of the city of Genoa. Related results are presented. © 2011 WIT Press.},

abstract={Herein, we proposed planning of wide transdisciplinary actions, which bring a solution for economic activity such as transportation, strongly related to pollution output with possible repercussions on climate change and public health. To solve logistics problem by introduction of common intermodal policy, and creation of more friendly transport solution, it is possible to obtain sustainable development, climate change prevention, government policy, and regulation which are all related to human health and creation of health-supportive environment. This approach permits environmental and biological monitoring same as economic results measurement by key performance indicators. This approach implementing emerging scientific knowledge in environmental health science such as genetic epidemiology aimed at understanding how genomic variation impacts phenotypic expression and how genes interact with the environment at the population level with subsequent translation into practical information for clinicians as well as for public health policy creation. © 2012 Natasa Gojkovic-Bukvic and Nenad Bukvic.},

abstract={The sustainable development of the west region of Romania can not be done without the sustainable development in the field of transportation. The paper analyses the way the development of the regional transport system contributes to the sustainable economical and social development. The regional transport system should be integrated in the European transport system. It supposes the rehabilitation and improvement of the regional transport and local infrastructure. So, the extension and the updating of the railway network and the improvement of the service quality, the modernisation of the naval transport infrastructure on the navigable ways and channels in the west region are the two directions by which transport becomes friendlier with the environment. Neither the air transport infrastructure is neglected, which is modernised by investments made in the international Traian Vuia airport of Timisoara. The road traffic will also benefit by the rehabilitation and improvement of the regional and local interest transport infrastructure. In order to reduce pollution urban intermodal transport systems are developed.},

abstract={This paper develops an economic assessment of a multimodal transport network for single pallets. A shipment- size choice model is estimated to calculate the shippers' reactions and their economic benefits from that transport network. In the model, the major factor influencing logistics decisions-the balance between warehouse and storage cost-is explicitly taken into account. The functional form is deduced from the first-order condition of the minimization problem of total logistics cost. Transport cost is expressed in the form of a complex function depending on shipment size and transport distance in order to capture the effect of economies of scale in transportation. The model parameters are estimated based on empirical data from two major German corporations. Simulations show that the new intermodal transportation system has a significant impact on the shipment-size distributions changing them in favor of smaller shipments. This leads especially to significant reductions in warehouse costs. Finally, some implications of the analytical results on transport policy are provided: To foster green logistics and achieve further modal shifts from road to rail, public financial support and the regulatory framework have to enable railways to consolidate small and logistics demanding shipments at an industrial scale. © Springer-Verlag 2012.},

abstract={Civil engineers plan, design, manage, and guide investments in surface transportation. Truck weight limits are inextricably linked to the consideration of pavements, bridges, safety, asset management, sustainability, jobs, and economic productivity. The U.S. 36.3 t cap for gross vehicle weight (GVW), and the Federal Bridge Formula B (FBF B) constrain truck movement of 32.5 t full ISO (International Organization for Standardization) containers. This study identifies the options-and associated implications-for trucks to transport full containers notwithstanding FBF B and the cap. We conducted a national investigation of truck weight regulations across 50 states to identify options, with 28 cases involving telephone interviews. Results show the options are complex, vary by state, result in a patchwork of routes, and include: (1) nondivisible permits, (2) special haul routes, (3) grandfather rights, (4) state roads, (5) tare reduction, and (6) operation outside formal regulations. Containerships, railroads, ports, and highways of U.S. trading partners each accommodate full containers. Conditions identified in this paper can result in underutilization of the productivity and efficiency benefits afforded by international standardization. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={The objective of the intermodal terminal location problem is to determine which of a set of potential terminal locations to use and how to route the supply and demand of a set of customers (representing zones of supply and demand) through the network (by both uni- and intermodal transport) so as to minimize the total cost. Two different metaheuristic procedures are developed that both consist of two phases: a solution construction phase (either GRASP or attribute based hill climber) and a solution improvement phase based on local search. Innovative in this approach is the integration of a fast heuristic procedure to approximate the total cost given the set of open terminals. Both metaheuristics are compared to the results of an MIP solver. A thorough performance assessment uncovers that both metaheuristics generate close-to-optimal solutions in very short computing times. An argument in favor of the ABHC approach is that it is parameter-free and hence more transparent and likely to be accepted in a business or policy environment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Plans for the development of high speed railway lines (HSR) in Spain were recently realised. At the beginning of 2010, four HSR lines were operating along routes where air transport was previously dominant. In this paper, we examine through econometric means the air carriers' reaction to these HSR entrances into the transport market with data at the route level. We test whether the HSR lines have affected the airlines' travel frequencies and market shares. Our results show that on average, HSR has reduced the number of air transport operations by 17 per cent. At the same time, travel demand has increased substantially, though the share of air transport in the total market has declined, as has the share of the dominant Spanish air carrier, Iberia. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Increasingly, the debate on freight transport and logistics involves the challenge of sustainable development. Key objectives of sustainable or "green" freight logistics systems are the mitigation of negative environmental and human health effects of distribution operations and the realization of a major modal shift in transport preferences, while at the same time achieving internal generalized cost efficiency and quality of services. Pursuing these goals requires the introduction of a range of measures. These measures call for private and public actors to take up various initiatives and adopt policies. Usually, it is more effective to combine different actions into an integrated package of measures than to introduce single instruments in isolation.This article explores the nexus between sustainability and port hinterland container logistics. In particular, the methodology and results of an empirical analysis based on applications of a network programming tool called the "interport model" are presented and discussed. The model enables an examination of all possible effects on inland container flows and their associated internal and external costs due to public and private initiatives in the field of port hinterland container logistics. The empirical analysis aims to evaluate the impact of a set of simultaneous policy options and operational measures on the competitiveness and sustainability of hinterland multimodal distribution of import and export containers handled at the seaports of the Campania region located in Southern Italy. The loading units can transit through the dry port facilities (the so called "interports") located in the same region and/or through extra regional railway terminals, before reaching their ultimate inland destinations or the seaports. The integrated package of measures simulated by means of the model includes: (i) infrastructure policy, (ii) improvements of rail services, (iii) regulatory changes in terms of customs authorizations and procedures, (iv) removal of technical and legal barriers to fair and non-discriminatory competition in the market of rail traction between regional seaports and interports, (v) new business models integrating container logistics operations between seaports and interports, and (vi) social marginal cost charging of transport operations. Once this package of instruments is introduced, higher private and social cost efficiency of port hinterland container distribution through the investigated regional logistics system can be achieved. For instance, it has been estimated an annual saving of the order of about 12,660 tonnes of CO 2 equivalent emissions from transport corresponding to an external cost reduction of 0.27 million euros from the observed real life situation, whereas the estimated saving in terms of air pollution (CO, NO x, PM, SO 2, VOC) from transport is approximately 220 tonnes per year corresponding to an external benefit of 1.31 million euros.The most immediate priority appears to be the customs and intermodal logistics integration of seaports and interports by means of full implementation of the "extended gateway" concept as a way to increase the rail share of modal split and improve the overall cost efficiency of the system. In addition, the simultaneous introduction of a social marginal cost charging policy can contribute to make the regional interports a viable solution to expand the hinterland reach of the regional seaport cluster. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The pressure for more sustainable operations is intense for the actors in the transport sector, and using intermodal road-rail transport is one measure to reduce CO2 emissions. The purpose of this paper is to examine the experiences of a large logistics provider in offering intermodal road-rail transport services, especially in connection with the company's environmental strategies. This case reveals how the environmental dimension changed intermodal train services into a competitive advantage. Nevertheless, there were challenges in making these services profitable. The case company Bring Frigo claims to be the leading cold storage transport provider in the Nordic countries. There were in-depth interviews conducted with key persons in Bring Frigo and an interview with the CEO of the contracted intermodal operator TX Logistics. The pressure for environmental improvements from customers had grown stronger, at least before the recession and the formulation of a goal for reductions of CO2 emissions were in focus. This internal pressure was steering the environmental work. Competitors are also struggling with pressure on costs and targets for reducing the emissions of CO2. This study gives insights into the perceived competitive pressure for more sustainable freight transport through a logistics provider and the experiences of intermodal transport services. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={An integrated alternative to road only or rail only transport does not exist in South Africa for domestic freight. This is in spite of the fact that national freight logistics costs are high, road infrastructure is challenged and concern for the environmental impact of road transport is increasing. These factors have renewed interest in intermodal transport solutions, which are the focus of this article. The question is whether a viable domestic intermodal solution can be found through segmenting freight flows and developing a business case based on these segments. The research confirms that this is possible and the segmentation and subsequent business case is presented. The results demonstrate that building three intermodal terminals to connect the three major industrial hubs - Gauteng, Durban and Cape Town - through an intermodal solution could reduce transport costs (including externalities) for the identified 22.9. million. tons of intermodal freight flows on the Cape and the Natal corridors by 64% (including externalities). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background: We analyzed the potential for the Panama Canal expansion to change CO2 and criteria pollutant emissions (oxides of nitrogen, oxides of sulfur and particulate matter) from Asia-US container flows by estimating the modal shift from landside truck/rail network to larger ships enabled by canal expansion. We develop an intermodal case study comparison within the Geospatial Intermodal Freight Transportation framework, assuming potential diversion of 1.2 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) to 5000 origin-destination pairs. Results: Potential TEU diversions of land-bridge transport through an expanded canal reduced mode-specific emissions substantially, but land-bridge emission reductions due to cargo diversion to post-Panamax vessels, with lower emissions per TEU, cannot offset higher waterborne emissions from longer routes. Conclusion: Green-freight policy measures must consider multimodal network solutions to maximize emission benefits. © 2012 Corbett et al.},

abstract={As the economy becomes increasingly specialised and globalised, the importance of logistics also increases. For global transportation systems, seaports play a key role as transhipment hubs. As seaports incorporate and coordinate hinterland logistic activities within the activities of the port, the strategies they employ influence the decisions made by both local and global logistic service providers. From an environmental and social perspective, seaports are thus key actors in transportation systems, and many ports have also developed corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies. This paper examines one such strategy - green port dues - and shows how the integration of hinterland logistics and ports opens the possibility for differentiated port dues to be used as a tool to internalise external cost in the transportation systems and ensure the effectiveness of hinterland transport. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Bicycles and transit systems are considered to be the pinnacle of green transportation. The combined use of the two could provide a competitive alternative for an integrated, green, and seamless service, yet relatively few studies have investigated the multimodal integration problems of the entire service chain from the perspective of users. Users' perceived inconvenience during travel can be regarded as a latent construct that describes an unobservable and immeasurable characteristic. Nevertheless, the traditional Likert method in an ordinal scale causes a misleading statistical inference. The Rasch model eliminates such bias generated by an ordinal scale through a logistic linear transformation, and it compares person parameters with item parameters, which are then subjected to a logarithmic transformation along a logit scale to clearly identify which service items' inconvenience cannot be easily overcome by certain users. This empirical study demonstrates that perceived inconveniences differ based on the users' sex, riding frequency, trip purpose, and environmental awareness. The differential item functioning analysis that was adopted in this study can identify the critical factors leading to the differences in perceived inconvenience. Our empirical results suggest that a male cyclist who is a commuter with a high monthly riding frequency and who is environmentally conscious has a better ability than their counterpart to overcome perceived inconveniences during travel using a bicycle-transit service. To effectively mitigate users' perceived inconvenience, the Rasch analytical results suggest that the improvement of the intra-transit system factors in the short term and the improvement of external environmental factors in the long term will be successful. The information herein proves useful for transportation planners and policy makers when considering the special travel needs of certain groups to create a user-friendly bicycle-transit travel environment that promotes its usage. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Accidents with hazardous materials may threaten the lives of people living in the direct environment of the transportation infrastructure. In many countries, fire brigades play a major role in advising the authorities when they are dealing with issues where hazardous materials are involved. Since emergency responders have to deal with injured persons, information concerning the number of injured people and the types of injuries is relevant to them. In response to this need, we developed a method for calculating the number of injured people. This method was applied to the (re)development plans for the largest railway station in the Netherlands, Utrecht Central station. Through this intermodal transfer terminal, both passengers and substantial amounts of hazardous materials are transported. The fire brigades used the injury information to assess the spatial development plans and transportation plans for hazardous materials. Furthermore, the fire brigades used the injury information to determine their suppression tactics and equipment requirements. Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={This paper looks at the environmental effects of shifting from road to rail freight transportation. Little data is available to shippers to calculate the potential CO2 savings of an intermodal shift. In this paper we analyze a data set of more than 400,000 intermodal shipments to calculate the CO2 intensity of intermodal transportation as a distinct mode. Our results indicate an average intensity of 67g of CO2 per ton-mile, but can vary between 29 and 220g of CO2 per ton-mile depending on the specific origin-destination lane. We apply the market area concept to explain the variance between individual lane intensities and demonstrate the complexity in predicting the potential carbon savings in a switch from truckload to intermodal. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Decreasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is one of the most important tasks for the society in the 21st century. One possibility to decrease emissions originating from transportation is to utilize more rails instead of relying simply on road transportation. In the dry port concept an inland intermodal terminal is connected to a sea port using railways. This study analyzes impacts of dry ports in a Finnish context. We compare two different configurations: In the first one shippers drive directly to a sea port, while in the second one they use dry ports. The systems are evaluated by using discrete-event simulation. In the systems we are interested in two issues: (1) Level of CO2 emissions, and (2) Costs to transport the goods in different configurations. We use different scenarios for future energy prices and estimate both the costs and CO2 emission development in these scenarios. We also compare the results to a situation, where emissions are minimized instead of costs. Implications on larger scale are also discussed, for example in the Baltic Sea and North Sea area, where strict sulfur emission restrictions are seen to harm sea transport and increase concentration on small number of sea ports. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Frequent gridlocks and traffic jams during the periods of rush hours can result in long user delays and more vehicle emissions causing continuous degradation of air quality. The built-infrastructure of densely populated cities and intercity travel by passenger and freight traffic lead to significant adverse impacts of traffic congestion on air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and global warming. Transportation contributes 28% of energy related greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. This paper shows that traffic related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are higher per capita for several rural and smaller cities compared to large urban areas in the United States. Inadequate use of mass transit, urban sprawl, construction of more roads and traditional stop-controlled intersections, and addition of more lanes to increase traffic capacity and ease congestion, are primary causes of significant vehicle emission inventory of CO2 and air quality degradation. It is shown that sustainable traffic management policies, such as reduction of work-related travel by cars and more use of mass transit modes, can decrease CO2 emissions. Case studies of value engineering applications are presented to select cost-effective less polluting mass transport strategies based on economic evaluation of life cycle costs and benefits. © 2013, Versita.

abstract={The transport of hazardous substances is an essential economic activity because it represents a quite relevant percentage of the total goods transportation. The risk associated to such an activity is fundamentally related to the possibility of an accident triggering that may cause negative environmental and public health consequences. A recent example is the Viareggio accident (2009), which involved the blast of tank wagons containing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and caused more than thirty deaths. In this paper, a modified algorithm for risk evaluation and a decision support system, called TrHaM (TRansport of HAzardous Materials), are proposed in order to both quantify the overall risk due to the transport of hazardous materials via road, railroad, waterway and pipeline and help in planning transport activities. The algorithm evaluates and shows the risk distribution using a stand-alone GIS software, which also considers sensitive targets with high crowding (such as schools, hospitals, shopping malls, stadiums and camping areas). Moreover, it allows for finding the transport solution and its logistics which minimize risk distribution, including intermodal shipping.TrHaM reliability has been tested onto the circulation of hazardous materials in the Varese district (Northern Italy). The area is characterized by a high level of both population and industrial density combined with heavy road traffic. TrHaM has been used with the aim of comparing the current scenario with a potential one that introduces some mitigating interventions which may reduce risk, such as a partial conversion of haulage from road to railway.},

abstract={Despite ongoing efforts, to promote its current share of the intermodal transport is low, as its supply and quality. This should be considered in the context of business internationalization and extreme congestion of freight transport market in general, characterized by low costs. In a tumultous business environment, congestion on the roads network and access to intermodal hubs is a critical issue, especially in urban areas and critical natural geographic barriers. Many highways have experienced long delays, especially in and near urban centers. Ports, airports and railway terminals are especially prone to congestion in peak times. In hand, as the current state of dissatisfaction and use of intermodal transport is caused by a legacy of poor infrastructure, low levels of interoperability, control fragmentation operational separation of operational control responsibilities, and institutional arrangements that are unclear, due to their transitional nature. In this global business climate is vital that transports should become faster, more reliable, more in connection with global players.},

abstract={This paper proposes new research themes concerning decision support in intermodal transport. Decision support models have been constructed for private stakeholders (e.g. network operators, drayage operators, terminal operators or intermodal operators) as well as for public actors such as policy makers and port authorities. Intermodal research topics include policy support, terminal network design, intermodal service network design, intermodal routing, drayage operations and ICT innovations. For each research topic, the current state of the art and gaps in existing models are identified. Current trends in intermodal decision support models include the introduction of environmental concerns, the development of dynamic models and the growth in innovative applications of Operations Research techniques. Limited data availability and problem size (network scale) and related computational considerations are issues which increase the complexity of decision support in intermodal transport. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess the performance of an online benchmarking tool developed for logistics service users and providers to provide alternative service option in Europe. Design/methodology/approach: First, conduct desktop research including but not limited to academic literature reviews on benchmarking, performance measurement and previous and current examples of online benchmarking tools in order to determine issues in the field; second, report the development process and functionalities of a benchmarking tool; third, examine the benchmarking tool through structured interviews with the users of the tool; and finally, draw conclusion as to whether the tool is effective or needs changes to make it more effective. Findings: Six Key Performance Indicators were identified: Transport cost, Transport time, Flexibility, Reliability, Quality, Sustainability. The functionality of an online transport chain benchmarking e-tool is detailed. The evaluation of the tool found that it is a strategic decision-making tool; cost is most often selected as the most important indicator; the majority would not use the tool for daily planning purposes. Future needs of development were identified, including using the tool for procurement decisions, and its utility in supporting corporate social responsibility and sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The benchmarking e-tool is developed for the 27 EU countries plus Norway and Switzerland. Thus, the research findings are primarily applicable for these countries and may not be applicable for other countries. Practical implications: The online tool has been used by multiple commercial companies actively involved, as a service provider or user, in the freight transport chain to plan their transport chains. Social implications: The tool makes the strategic planning of intermodal and co-modal transport solutions easier and supports exploring sustainable freight transport choices in Europe. Originality/value: The paper meets a research need to evaluate a newly-developed online benchmarking tool, as well as detailing the e-tool, and setting it within the practice and policy in this field. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Deregulation of the North American railroad industry continues to be controversial (Trunick, 2010). Class I American and Canadian rail carriers have exploited the policy environment, consolidated and prospered. However, some of their customers, the "captive" shippers, have complained about lack of competition, higher rates and deteriorating service. This paper reviews developments in the industry over the last four decades, and looks to the future in discussing policy implications. Each decade is characterized by an important event or development impacting the industry, as follows: 1970-1979 is the decade of deregulation; 1980-1989, the decade of intermodal growth; 1990-1999, the decade of mega-mergers; and 2000-2009, the decade of rising oil prices. The paper also draws on secondary data to analyze the impact of deregulation and other factors on rail freight rates, service and traffic volume. The industry faces new challenges and opportunities due to increasing demand for rail service, rising fuel costs and concerns about emissions. To meet the rising demand, rail capacity will have to increase. Given that rail is generally "greener" than trucking, an important public policy question is whether the government should facilitate further modal shifting via some sort of carbon tax. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The study investigates development of new intermodal transport solutions with specific focus on solutions where customers, the shippers, choose to develop and manage their own intermodal solutions instead of buying the transport service in the market. The purpose of the paper is to study the design aspects of customer managed intermodal transport system development to see what makes such systems competitive. Focus is on why shippers develop such solutions; how they solve fundamental performance problems; and what characterises such shippers. Shippers engage in development and management of intermodal solutions based on perceived weak signals about future threats and opportunities. Intermodal solutions are designed to meet cost, quality, and environmental requirements. Shippers engaging in development of such solutions have large and concentrated flows. Furthermore, they have strong environmental policies, and are highly dependent on efficient transport. Finally, they are major buyers in the transport market having previous experience in using rail/intermodal. Copyright © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={A global distribution channel with a reliable freight transport system is essential in the contemporary world economy. Acting as trade facilitators, seaports are important players in the system. The study of the role of ports in supply chain management has recently drawn increasing attention from researchers and industry professionals alike. However, prior works mainly gathered the views from ports and terminals. To the authors'knowledge, no attempt by previous empirical studies has been made to cover the perspective from shippers and logistics providers, who are obviously taking a serious role in the process of global freight movements as major stakeholders. It becomes thus imperative to assess a port's supply chain orientation and performance from the perspective of the port users in the supply chain. Studying ports in the network context would be even more beneficial to capture the complexity needed to understand port performance and its interaction with various stakeholders. Drawing reference from multi-disciplinary fields, this paper aims to fill in the gap by developing a so-called unified framework for analysing port's integration in global freight supply chains including shipping line networks, hinterland and intermodal transport network, and even urban network. The framework embraces a wider group of stakeholders involved, for example, terminal operators, port authorities, shippers, shipping companies, inland transport providers, freight forwarders/logistics service providers, cities and other ports in the networks. A port that is a key node in these networks simultaneously would be able to create and sustain value for port stakeholders. Port authorities and operators can refer to the framework as their network performance indicators so as to obtain a better understanding of the various considerations in a port's network performance and to assist in positioning the port within the complex dynamics in the context of global freight supply chains. Finally, the framework developed in the paper can serve as a guide to empirical examinations of an emerging theme - a network-oriented performance by seaports along global freight supply chains - leading to various possible channels in future research. © 2013, Versita.

abstract={As a consequence of the problems of sustainability caused by the growth of road transport, short sea shipping (SSS) has attracted much attention from the European Union in recent years. Road hauliers, as clients of shipping companies, constitute a key player in the development of SSS. For these firms, the use of this transport mode implies a change to their traditional all-road transport operations. Consequently, if these firms want to maintain stable operations in the SSS context, they need to face the challenge of modifying their profile and adopt an appropriate organisational structure. The aim of this article is twofold: first, to analyse, in the context of roll on-roll off SSS, the two possible operating strategies for road transport firms: accompanied versus unaccompanied transport, in an attempt to determine their characteristics and the factors that condition their use; and second, to analyse the challenges facing international hauliers by changing the process from the all-road transport option to the use of unaccompanied transport in SSS operations, and how these challenges are addressed. A study is made of five international road hauliers that have adapted to become intermodal transport operators. Our findings reveal five key areas for change: organisation of haulage and fleet restructuring, restructuring of driving staff, changes in the operating model and development of coordination capabilities, improving the commercial capacity at destination, and establishing an adequate infrastructure to organise haulage in the destination country.

abstract={Economic development and investment capabilities of a country correlate with the concept of transport network development and the possibilities of integrating the Croatian transport system into the trans-European transport networks. The extremely favourable geographic-traffic position of Croatia is an important factor for its fast integration into the European transport system. Having thus defined the scientific problem, the author's research has been directed towards identification, evaluation and analysis of the main effects that the routes defined by the Adriatic transport waterway might have on economy and environment. The goal of the paper is to scientifically define: the strategic guidelines of transport system integration, especially intermodal transport system and its potential for environment protection, current development possibilities of transport in Croatia in the framework of EU transport network organisation concept, anticipating sea and land flow of goods as important accelerators of both European and Croatian transport and economic growth, complementarity with EU funds and other international financial institutions, including the proposal of the model of environmental protection of the Adriatic. The implementation of the proposed model and intensification of traffic through the Adriatic waterway, thus reducing the intensity of road transport in coastal areas, as well as integrated management of coastal area by interested parties, might contribute more efficiently to the protection of the Adriatic by achieving sustainable economic development as an important strategic resource and challenge for Croatia.},

abstract={The port regionalisation concept extended earlier spatial models of port development with a focus on institutional relationships governing the complexity of inland connections. The concept accounts for the fact that modern ports operate in an increasingly complex and sophisticated transport and logistics environment, embedded within multi-scalar planning regimes. This paper addresses the role of intermodal transport in port regionalisation by reviewing the literature on the three core aspects of the concept: intermodal terminals, inland logistics and collective action problems.Results reveal that inland terminals developed by landside actors often experience a conflict of strategy with port actors (either port authorities or terminal operators). Port actors have difficulty acting beyond the port perimeter but some port terminal operators have begun to demonstrate successful investments in inland terminals in order to manage their container throughput more strategically. Inland logistics markets tend to be centralised and focus heavily on domestic flows, thus the efficiency of intermodal freight services is challenged by the need to combine port and domestic movements which have different product, route and equipment characteristics. Collective action is an arena where port actors can be influential due to the role of informal networking in managing freight corridors; however, institutional constraints limit their ability to act directly.The findings in this paper elucidate challenges to the ability of ports to control or capture hinterlands through the strategies of integration that the port regionalisation concept proposes. The paper concludes by proposing a research agenda developing from recent institutional adaptations of port actors as a result of these challenges. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This study proposes models for projecting reductions in CO2 emissions of 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% compared to business as usual (BAU), using a carbon allowance allocation policy and both unimodal and intermodal modes of transportation. The results show that for 10% to 80% decreases in free carbon allowance, the intermodal ratio increased from 1.01% to 53.44%, which led to decreases in carbon emissions and demand ranging from 10.41% to 48.19% and 8.45% to 7.57%, respectively. When free carbon allowances are decreased, the demand for intermodal systems increases accordingly. These results suggest that a carbon allowance allocation policy could mitigate transportation carbon emissions with a relatively small negative impact on economic activity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={As container transport volumes continue to grow, the sea flow generates almost proportional inland flow; the links with hinterland will become critical factors for the seaports functionality. Intermodal transport with dry ports could be a potential solution for seaport terminal congestion as well as for better seaport inland access that might be based on short haul rail. Intermodal transport is generally considered to be viable on markets with larger flows or longer distances; however, due to cost of congestion, growing environmental constraints, but also due to competition between seaports, the break-even distance for inland intermodal transport could be very market dependent. Therefore the purpose of this paper is to analyse effects of directional development of dry ports on sustainability of intermodal transport based on a short haul rail.

abstract={Today, there is widespread consensus about the notable, yet simultaneously growing, negative environmental impacts generated by the transportation sector. Experts working in a number of different fields consider the current situation to be unsustainable and possible measures to reduce emissions and foster sustainability are being encouraged. The European Commission has highlighted the need to shift away from unimodal road transport toward a greater use of intermodal transport through, for example, motorways of the sea, in light of the evidence that the former makes a significant contribution to increased CO2 emissions. However, although there is a general perception that sea transport is environmentally preferable to road transport, recent studies are beginning to question this assumption. Moreover, little research has been conducted to quantify environmental aspects and incorporate them into the decision-making processes involved in the modal shift. This study first reviews the existing literature to examine the extent to which environmental aspects are relevant in the modal choice in the case of short sea shipping and motorways of the sea. Related to this, the study also evaluates the role that different agents may play in making decisions about choice of mode, taking into consideration environmental aspects. Secondly, we use the values the European Commission provides to calculate external costs for the Marco Polo freight transport project proposals (call 2013) to estimate the environmental costs for several routes (a total of 72), comparing the use of road haulage with the intermodal option that incorporates the Spanish motorways of the sea. The results of this comparative analysis show that the intermodal option is not always the best choice in environmental terms. Consequently, the traditional environmental argument to justify this alternative must be used carefully.},

abstract={Contemporary modes in intercontinental transportation are sea and air freight. The geographical connection of Eurasia additionally enables rail freight via the Eurasian landbridge. This transport concept reduces lead time compared to sea freight at lower cost than air or sea-air freight and hence fits into a strategic niche between established modes. These characteristics facilitate developments in supply chain management like increasing transport distances and continuous cost reduction together with relatively new trends (smaller, but more frequent shipments, flexibility and sustainability) that are only partly satisfied by contemporary modes. At this moment, the Eurasian landbridge is at an immature state, used by few shippers. This paper intends to identify factors that enable, respectively, inhibit Eurasian rail freight and understand how inhibitors can be overcome. The research based on case studies reviewing literature and conducting interviews to investigate individual landbridge routes. Besides providing secondary data, literature identified stakeholders and thus served as input for 24 semi-structured interviews to gather primary data. Both data streams were then combined to reveal the current attractiveness of Eurasian rail freight. A future outlook in the closing section aims at stimulating further research and thinking in order to create a viable alternative for global supply chain management. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Under the ongoing influence of globalisation, supply chains have changed significantly. New logistics and manufacturing systems have emerged, causing longer transport distances and increasing transport emissions. The existing research into the sustainability impacts of freight transport has largely viewed it as being a macro-level economic and political phenomenon and has ignored the interdependencies amongst micro-level economic actors, including firms and businesses in the private sector. In this paper, we presume that the lack of conceptualisation of freight transport in relation to wider institutional contexts and firm behaviour results in the lack of a holistic approach to understanding freight governance in the face of globalisation. We argue for the use of institutional economic geography lenses to elucidate the distribution networks of emerging logistics and manufacturing practices and its implications for freight transport. We illustrate our argument through a broad look at the European logistics and manufacturing practices and global production. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={In the EU White Paper on Transport 2011 the emphasis was laid on green transport corridors, i.e. transhipment routes with concentration of freight traffic between major hubs and by relatively long distances of transport marked by reduced environmental and climate impact while increasing safety and efficiency with application of sustainable logistics solutions. Green transport is based on inter-modality and advanced ICT-systems improving traffic management, increase efficiency and better integrate the logistics components of a corridor. Until today only the first steps have been realised in the implementation of green corridor concepts, so that concrete requirements and frame conditions for ICT-systems of green corridors are described on conceptual basis. Baltic Sea Region (BSR) enjoys a vanguard position in the development and realisation of green transport concepts in Europe and some research projects delivered already the first results for the requirements of ICT-systems supporting green transport corridors. Of special importance is the EU initiative "East-West Transport Corridor (EWTC II)" since for the first time a green corridor manual has been presented formulating recommendations and requirements of green transport corridors to European level. The authors took part in some important green transport corridor initiatives around the Baltic Sea, including EWTC project, and were involved in related research activities. This paper aims at pointing out the current status and the future direction of ICT-systems for green transport corridors, especially under the viewpoint of secure and sustainable green corridor management.},

abstract={The paper analyses the impact of: 1) CO2 pricing; 2) using biodiesel on the multimodal freight transport system in and through the Netherlands taking the changes in the transport demands for road, rail, and inland waterway into account. Special attention is given to the impact on the market share of various barge classes in inland waterway transport. This paper presents the GIS-based multimodal flow estimation model which is applied in the scenario analysis to simulate, visualise, and evaluate the impacts of the tested policies. The scenario analysis shows that the impact of CO2 pricing is limited in terms of both reducing CO2 emissions and realising modal shift. Pricing CO2 at €90 per ton or using biodiesel B30 (a blend of 30% biofuel and 70% diesel) would achieve similar effects on the total transport network cost increase and modal shift from road to intermodal transport. The analysis shows also that the largest class of barge (VIb) would be less cost efficient than class Va barges if the fuel costs increased by 50%, because the benefit gained by Va barges from less fuel consumption per TEU per km would be higher than the cost saving per TEU per km gained by VIb barges from the scale economy of barge size.

abstract={Most of perishable goods, such as fruit and vegetables, are transported in Europe by truck and clogging up the main road networks. The increasing demand for freight transport and the environmental concerns all indicate the necessity to embrace new means of transport such as the intermodal one using swap bodies and reefer containers that allow for the use of interchangeable truck, train, and ship to reduce direct and external costs. This research aims to analyze some essential readjustments that must be made in order to increase efficiency in the logistics of refrigerated fruit and vegetables. To do so, some hypotheses were analyzed and formulated in which the strategic use of the truck was recognized and inserted as part of an intermodal transport system. The transport options of a combined use of ships and trains in association with trucks were evaluated with respect to the current prevalent conventional solution of exclusive use of trucks. The results of the comparison between the intermodal and conventional transport were shown to be economically more convenient with respect to both legal and illegal transport by exclusive truck transport, presenting lower per unit costs (swap body or semi-trailer, containing the same amount of goods). Moreover, the intermodal solution scores equal or higher transit times in the comparison with the "transit by regulation compliance" and much higher transit times if compared with the "illegal" option. Therefore, the regulation compliance aspect would partially promote the use of intermodal options in a future fair competition. In addition, besides reducing the direct costs, it produces several other positive effects in terms of external costs to the society such as to reduce road crashes, noises, atmospheric emissions and greenhouse effect.},

abstract={Design/methodology/approach – The research used a mixed-methods approach where qualitative case interviews and quantitative modeling was combined. Two cases of contractual relationships between a service provider and its intermodal train operator on a specific lane were investigated. The case findings were then consolidated and used as input for a model of the contractual relation. Findings were sought through an extensive numerical study.
Findings – The cases reported that intermodal rail operators had a strong production focus, transferring the capacity risk (i.e. the risk of unused capacity) to the service provider, which the service providers argued limited the shift from truck to intermodal transportation. The paper shows that, due to the market structure, it is rational for the operator to transfer the capacity risk but not the profit. Consequently, a modal shift is only likely to occur when there is strong shipper pressure or low capacity risk. We present a risk-sharing contract that could release this dead lock. Research limitations/implications – The conclusions are modeling outcomes subject to assumptions based on the cases. For further validation, large-scale quantitative studies are necessary.
Practical implications – The paper shows that a three-part tariff in which the capacity risk is shared may lead to increased modal shift and hence assumed improved environmental performance. Social implications – Instead of arguing for operators to be more customer-focussed, policy makers and other stakeholders may have more to gain by having both actors being more cooperation focussed.
Originality/value – The paper is the first attempt to quantify how the contractual relations on the freight transportmarket affect the modal mix and thus the financial and environmental efficiency of freight transport.
Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate contracts of the intermodal transport market and the incentives they create for a modal shift and thus the financial and environmental efficiency of freight transport. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: A major task concerning the greening of freight transportation is to influence the process of choosing an appropriate transport solution for a shipment. This paper presents the results of a detailed environmental benchmark study of freight transport chains recorded during a shipper survey administered in Switzerland in 2008. Materials and methods: For the environmental evaluation, life cycle assessment was applied and enhanced with a new method for integrating damage to human health caused by traffic accidents based on the disability adjusted life year concept. Results and discussion: The results show that in land-based transport, road generally has a lower environmental performance compared to intermodal and rail-only transport. Exceptions exist, e.g. for long pre- and post-haulage distances in intermodal transport or for very low train-load factors the most relevant environmental interventions to pay attention to are, according to the methods applied, emissions of CO 2, NOx and particulates as well as accident damages. Conclusions: Rail transport is often, but not always, environmentally preferable than truck transport. Accident damages to human health should be included in each benchmark study. For practical application, a simplified benchmark methodology is proposed requiring a reduced level of detail for the input data. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={At present, the distribution of palletized building materials is mostly carried out by trucks, despite their movements having negative effects on society, the economy and the environment. However, these problems can be reduced if the transport of palletized goods is shifted to inland waterways. By doing so, the goods are bundled for the main haulage by barge. In order to reduce the transport distances by truck to an absolute minimum, a possible last-mile distribution would have to be organized via a limited number of directly canal-served hubs. The locations of those hubs are crucial for the feasibility of modal shift. This study advances the transport geography literature by elaborating a location analysis model specifically for palletized goods. This model determines the optimal hub location by taking into account the large variation of origins and destinations of transport flows, while the introduction of a cost structure enables potential economic gains (cost savings) and reductions in CO2 emissions to be calculated. The analysis is performed for transport data on palletized building materials in Belgium. Two concepts were defined, which resulted in an optimal intermodal network of 9 hubs and one with 27 hubs; through the implementation of these networks, respectively 26% and 38% of the transport flows can be shifted to the inland waterways at a profitable cost. It can be expected that over time these percentages will increase further. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In order to reduce energy use and cut emissions that contribute to climate change, countries need to radically reinvent their fossil-fuel intensive transportation systems. As a major consumer of energy and contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the U.S. transportation sector faces extraordinary challenges in the twenty-first century. Transportation in the U.S. depends heavily on fossil-fuel dependent cars and planes to the near exclusion of more energy-efficient electric trains. In order to address this concern, some policy makers refer to "technological optimism" which seeks no systemic change but instead focuses on employing technology to reduce the energy demand and environmental impact of the status quo. On the other hand, some researchers suggest a systematic paradigm shift away from cars and planes to intermodal systems that improve the sustainability of the system as a whole. High-speed rail (HSR) is arguably such an investment that can further this shift and help to achieve a more diversified and balanced transportation system. In this respect, by largely examining the role of the U.S. cars and planes "culture" in the economy, this paper elaborates on how building a HSR system may help U.S. advance towards environmental sustainability in transportation, make a break from the status quo, and create a more balanced, multimodal transportation system that will improve the quality and efficiency of travel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The paper develops a combined dynamic procurement and transport model for performance evaluation by explicitly considering fluctuating prices of raw material, alternative transport modes as well as contract types. In a dynamic environment the procurement managers face (i) the challenge to select the right strategy (i.e. transport mode and contract type) and (ii) in each period the decision whether to procure or not, depending on the price; in case of procurement, the price-dependent quantity must be determined. For tackling the decision problems of procurement, contract price and transport mode, we propose an approach motivated by demand models depending on the reservation price which is derived from revenue management. Alternative strategies are characterised by the contract type (short-term, long-term and portfolio), by the possibility to hold speculative inventories or not, and by the modes of transport including intermodal and multi-mode transport. Based on the procurement, transport and inventory costs, the performance of selected strategies is illustrated for a real supply process in the chemical industry using dynamic process analysis. The findings show that the most efficient strategies lead to reduction of average total procurement costs between 8 and 18%. Subsequently, managerial guidelines are derived for the selection of the most appropriate strategy. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.},

abstract={Every commute practice possesses a different degree and quality of technological mediation. Some mobilities scholars suggest that particular types of modal mediation may either alienate the traveller from, or connect them with, their passing environment. This research draws on forty-six in-depth interviews with drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians commuting in the City of Vancouver, and their commute narratives and GPS logs, to compare the relationships that these participants have with their passing social landscapes. The results both support and productively complicate the theories of modally induced alienation and connection with other concepts such as isolation and marginalization. Intermodal empathy, as formed through multi-mode use, offers hope, at least for mobilities interactions. The article concludes with several policy recommendations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={South Africa is predominantly a carbon economy. The coal supply chain impacts on the environment commences with mining, processing, transportation and processing by the end users. The country possess the largest coal reserves in the African continent, it is among the leading producers in the world and one of the top twenty leading nations in carbon emissions globally. Coal is the primary source of energy in South Africa producing 88% of the total electricity generation and one-third of liquid fuels production. Hence, the needs for greening the coal supply chain.The South African government newly adopted national development plan for the next twenty years proposes future reduction for coal dependency by boosting development of renewables sources of energy despite their high implementation cost. There are new legislations in support of clean energy development and sustainability initiative as mandated by the United Nations Convention on Climate Change. Greening the coal supply chain require combined efforts from the government and the industry. The focus areas include use of clean technologies in mining, processing, burning coal at power stations and the industries. Improved transportation system in form of intermodal transport with emphasis on the rail use over the road and maintaining or increasing the use of conveyor belts where appropriate would be the future for the coal value chain. However, increased use of renewable energy, use of natural gas and shale gas for the generation of electricity as they produce less carbon emissions would be the ultimate goal for greening the South African coal supply chain. © 2014, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

abstract={Today, in Romania, we can state that may require regulatory intervention where public interest is expected to differ materially from the commercial interests of public service providers usually private companies. Yet, the literature states this situation as "market failure" considering that the public interest may be compromised if the market fails to deliver government objectives such as national security, national cohesion and social policy objectives. In Europe governments determine what they think is needed to make the railways pay for the cost of doing so. These are obligations of the state that focus on regulating monopoly power rail and the development of competition, safety and environmental protection, and the establishment of technical standards. In this paper we propose to analyze the management of the public service contract through the current regulations in the field and to correlate trends in railway industry the specific situation in our country. So the question arises whether in the public service contract management railway industry can speak liberalization in terms of infrastructure or over regulatory monopoly is the only option. To obtain an objective response we conducted a series of comparative analyzes and SWOT considering the context of Romanian railway industry. Were defined and decontextualized concepts such as Public Service Obligation (PSO) and Public Service Contracts (PSC). Solutions have been proposed that promise social and economic benefits but were given the risks of these solutions. We remain dependent on the idea that past problems once again become current and not admit the old solutions especially after the global economic crisis.},

abstract={Global trade has increased nearly 100-fold since 1950, according to the World Trade Organization. Today, major changes in trade are occurring with the advent of mega-ships that can transport thousands more containers than cargo ships now in use. Because global trade is expected to increase dramatically, the railroad industry-in the U.S. alone-has invested more than $5 billion a year over the past decade to expand rail yards and enhance rail routes to transport goods from ports to retail destinations. This article describes cancer risks for residents living in close proximity to rail yards with emissions of diesel particulate matter pollution from locomotives, trucks and yard equipment. The article examines the demographics (income, race/ethnicity) of populations living in the highest estimated cancer risk zones near 18 major rail yards in California, concluding that the majority are over-represented by either lower-income or minority residents (or both). The authors also describe a review of the news media and environmental impact reports to determine if rail yards are still being constructed or expanded in close proximity to homes and schools or in working class/working poor communities of color. The paper suggests policy efforts that might provide more public health protection and result in more "environmentally just" siting of rail yards. The authors conclude that diesel pollution from rail yards, which creates significant diesel cancer risks for those living near the facilities, is an often overlooked public health, health disparities and environmental justice issue in the U.S. The conclusions are relevant to other countries where international trade is increasing and large new intermodal rail facilities are being considered. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Medium to long-distance intermodal transport has been strongly promoted by the European Commission and national governments as a solution for ensuring the sustainability of the freight transport sector. However, so far, intermodal transport has revealed limited capacity for competing against road transport. New solutions aimed at expanding the limits of its competitiveness are needed. Some successful cases of short-distance intermodal transport reveal untapped market opportunities.The literature on mode choice fails to explain these successes. The research has focused mainly on long-distance services, and the findings are not necessarily transferable to the short-distance transport. This paper presents the results of research aimed at testing this assumption.A new agent-based model to simulate the transport operations and behavioural reactions of transport agents was developed, applying mode choice variables that are consensually referred to as pivotal in the mode choice process: price, transit time, reliability and flexibility. The use of the model was to ascertain the performance of competing transport modes (intermodal and road) under different demand scenarios.Applications of the model to a short-distance transport service show that only price could explain the Freight Forwarder choice for intermodality. The evidence produced by this research suggests that the mode choice process for short-distance transport services may be governed by other decision variables and that current intermodality-oriented policy options should be revised, as they exclude a potential market segment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Among the most important trade-related issues currently confronting the UK are the environmental implications of very large volumes of containerised freight being handled at a small number of ports while there appears to be significant potential for using other ports and water-rail intermodal connections. Six UK ports are selected for the analysis: Hull/Immingham, Liverpool, Felixstowe, Southampton, Dover and Bristol. Through an origin-destination analysis, the cost and CO2e impacts of UK port trade patterns are compared using the actual situation against three proposed Scenarios: (1) the re-direction of containers by a combined expansion of Hull and Immingham; Liverpool; and Bristol, (2) moving containers by rail facilitated via expanded capacity at Southampton, and (3) moving containers by rail through expanded capacity at Felixstowe. The research found that transporting containers from Felixstowe and Southampton to the northern regions by rail has the lowest CO2e impact, and is the most feasible option, although constraints exist in terms of infrastructure provision, water depth and rail network capacity. © 2014.},

abstract={We present an ad hoc geospatial origin-destination model that utilizes the rudiments of operations research optimization techniques to estimate feasible multimodal routes that may or may not be geospatially connected. The model is designed to determine and optimize large-scale container flows from US trade partners to inland markets mainly located within the lower 48 states. The dynamic traffic assignment for the freight flow considers several factors such as congestion, volume/capacity (V/C) ratio, throughput and distance-based impedance and the Geographic Information Systems platform provides a visualization environment for all feasible routes. Visual analytics with the resultant geographical distribution maps indicate that maritime containers are concentrated on the West Coast whereas rail shipments are densely concentrated along rail transshipment points such as Chicago, Memphis and Dallas. The highway transportation densities are mainly visible with origins from marine ports to associated market destinations starting from hinterland and radiating further away from these primal areas to other inland intermodal terminals that serve major landlocked metropolitan cities that are not served by railway networks. Our critical finding indicates that some routes, which are not generally considered as prime routes, may actually offer the best alternatives especially when considering global supply chains. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

abstract={Container terminals pay more and more attention to the service quality of inland transport modes such as tucks, trains and barges. Truck appointment systems are a common approach to reduce truck turnaround times. This paper provides a tool to use the truck appointment system to increase not only the service quality of trucks, but also of trains, barges and vessels. We propose a mixed integer linear programming model to determine the number of appointments to offer with regard to the overall workload and the available handling capacity. The model is based on a network flow representation of the terminal and aims to minimize overall delays at the terminal. It simultaneously determines the number of truck appointments to offer and allocates straddle carriers to different transport modes. Numerical experiments, conducted on actual data, quantify the benefits of this combined solution approach. Discrete-event simulation validates the results obtained by the optimization model in a stochastic environment. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This article describes the development of a geographic information systems (GIS) based biomass transport analysis tool BIT-UU used in combination with the European renewable energy model Green-X. BIT-UU calculates cost and GHG emissions from lowest cost routes, using intermodal transport (by road, rail, inland waterways and sea) between origins of supply and demand destinations. With the developed biomass trade module in Green-X, the role of bioenergy can be evaluated in the larger context of renewable energy deployment. The modeling framework takes into account the current and future energy policies at EU and country levels, competition with alternative sources of renewable energy (e.g. photovoltaic, wind) and sectors (electricity, heat, transport fuels) as well as competition between EU member states for the same biomass resources. Scenario projections to 2020 are used to demonstrate the developed modeling framework. According to these scenarios, biomass from domestic supply remains the most important source of bioenergy (91-93% in 2020). However, the role of traded solid biomass will become increasingly important. With a business as usual scenario, assuming continuation of current renewable energy policies to 2020, the binding renewable energy targets will not be achieved, but trade of solid biomass will still increase up to 451. PJ in 2020. In the scenario that meets the conditions to achieve the 20% renewable energy target in 2020, traded solid biomass is projected to increase to 440. PJ if sustainability criteria are applied (minimum GHG saving) and 506. PJ without these sustainability regulations. Because imports of solid biomass from outside the EU are projected to become larger than intra-EU trade in the scenarios, the scenarios show the importance of improving the representation of extra-EU biomass sources and trade in the modeling framework. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This paper identifies research opportunities which will enable the further integration of inland waterway transport in the intermodal supply chain. Intermodal transport may be interpreted as a chain of actors who supply a transport service. Inland navigation can play a crucial role in increasing supply chain service performance. A first group of research challenges lies in the evolving relationship between transport geography and logistics activities. The next set of research challenges has the objective to encourage efficient operations in IWT: development of a system wide model for IWT, integration of operational planning systems and analysis of bundling networks. A third group of research efforts is directed towards shippers and consignees who use the intermodal transport chain to send or receive their goods: further development of models that integrate intermodal transport decisions with supply chain decisions and creation of green supply chains. A fourth cluster of research challenges concerns the problem domain of external cost calculations. Finally detailed time series data on freight transport should be collected to support these future research tracks. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Despite of the importance of the freight transportation at the world economy, this industry is not economic, social and environmental friendly. Based on the collaborative methodology, this article only introduces some aspects of the resource sharing intermodal transportation model. This model was created and its next step is to assessment the impact of resource sharing of intermodal freight transportation. We present the general resource sharing intermodal transportation model and simulation model, as well, the performance indicators to evaluate the freight network performance. © 2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The challenges facing the logistics industry in a fossil fuel-challenged global economy are highlighted by transportation's rising contribution to logistics costs, as evidenced in the USA's and South Africa's logistics costs time series, the two longest-running such series available globally. The anticipated persistence of rising, volatile oil prices and mounting pressure to account for externalities will exacerbate the increase in transport costs (TCs). The results of South Africa's externality cost model show that transport externalities add an additional 18% to already high TCs. In the South African context, the equally largest contributors to freight transport externalities are accidents involving road freight vehicles and road freight emissions. The visibility of these costs is the first step towards internalisation and illustrates the desirability of a fundamental shift in the structure of the South African freight transport industry through the introduction of long-distance intermodal solutions. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The intermodal transport of freight overseas have promoted since the origin in 2001 of the &quot;Motorway of the Sea&quot; concept in Europe, the development of transport tools by the European Comission through different communitarian programs (Marco Polo I and II) and the funding coming from the Transeuropean Networks. Thanks to all the above mentioned, many positive results towards environmentally friendly ways of transporting have been achieved. The financial crisis and the changes in the European transport policies are resulting in new EU strategies oriented towards technological development, sustainability, energy efficiency and job creation. The use of LNG as marine fuel and the specialization of the human factor in the maritime transport chain are two future bets for enhancing the &quot;Motorways of the Sea&quot; concept and where Spain plays an important role.},

abstract={Effective transport is impeded by a number of caveats, including problems of accessibility to the destination, poor infrastructure, social, and environmental issues. In this context, the implementation of intermodal solutions is essential to meet customer demand, resolve problems of transport supply, and enhance destination competitiveness. Based on a suitable theoretical framework, this paper examines the attitude of Greek passengers towards intermodal transport and their willingness-to-pay more to be provided with such a seamless service to allow for (partial at least) cost recovery of the related transport infrastructure. The findings suggest that there are many respondents who would actually pay more to be provided with a door-to-door intermodal travel experience; answers are highly dependent on their place of residence. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Traffic management systems are generally used to reduce traffic congestion and improve road safety. The paper presents the effect of traffic management systems on vehicle emissions and environment pollution levels. It also presents the most common types of traffic management systems used and their possible effects on vehicle emissions and consumption of fuel. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is not a pollutant but a greenhouse gas which contributes mainly to global warming effects and which is associated with climate changes. The field of transport is one of the main sectors of economy with impact on climate change, in which an action plan for reducing CO2 emissions is required. Using public transport on a larger scale, combined with the minimum service obligation, will allow increasing the density and frequency of services, thus generating very good premises for public transport modes development. Demand management and landscaping plans can reduce the traffic volumes.},

abstract={Quality of service should not be overlooked in public transport planning and policy making, as it influences modal shift from car use to more sustainable means. Little research has been conducted on the quality of public transport interchanges from the perspective of current travellers (i.e. perceived quality). This work thus aimed to identify key quality factors at urban interchanges through an exploratory approach (multiple correspondence analysis) that provides novel elements for further investigation. The methodology was applied at interchanges in Madrid and Gothenburg and the data used in the analysis were collected through customer satisfaction surveys conducted in 2011. The analysis identified five key quality factors per interchange. Ticketing plays a key role at both interchanges while physical and environmental issues emerged at Avenida de Ame´ rica in Madrid, and services, temporal issues and interconnectivity characterise Gothenburg central station. Compared with other quality aspects, classical issues such as safety/security and information are not perceived as important by intermodal travellers. © 2015, ICE Publishing: All rights reserved},

abstract={Multimodal processes planning and scheduling play a pivotal role in many different domains including city networks, multimodal transportation systems, computer and telecommunication networks and so on. Multimodal process can be seen as a process partially processed by locally executed cyclic processes. In that context the concept of a Mesh-like Multimodal Transportation Network (MMTN) in which several isomorphic subnetworks interact each other via distinguished subsets of common shared intermodal transport interchange facilities (such as a railway station, bus station or bus/tram stop) as to provide a variety of demand-responsive passenger transportation services is examined. Consider a mesh-like layout of a passengers transport network equipped with different lines including buses, trams, metro, trains etc. where passenger flows are treated as multimodal processes. The goal is to provide a declarative model enabling to state a constraint satisfaction problem aimed at multimodal transportation processes scheduling encompassing passenger flow itineraries. Then, the main objective is to provide conditions guaranteeing solvability of particular transport lines scheduling, i.e. guaranteeing the right match-up of local cyclic acting bus, tram, metro and train schedules to a given passengers flow itineraries. © 2015 Archives of Control Sciences.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a transport portfolio framework (TPF) and explore its use as a decision support tool for shippers wanting to improve their transport system in terms of reducing their carbon footprint. Design/methodology/approach - The TPF has been designed on the basis relevant theoretical frameworks in logistics and thereafter tested and further developed by the use of empirical data from a case study. Quantitative methods are used to find patterns in the shipment statistics for import flows obtained from a food retailer and carriers. Findings - The TPF highlights different avenues for decreasing the carbon footprint, by identifying the product flow characteristics that might affect modal split and load factor, and it is believed that these can help shippers' intent on analysing the largest potential for improvement. This potential is estimated based on how the key variables, modal split and load factor, can be improved. Practical implications - Shippers can use the TPF as a decision support tool in their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint by: structuring complexity, managing data and finding effective solutions. Social implications - Reducing emissions is an increasingly important priority for shippers and the TPF helps them to direct their efforts towards approaches that have a substantial impact. Originality/value - The TPF provides an opportunity to match different approaches for improving the environmental performance with the potential for reducing carbon footprint in shippers' transportation networks, by taking into account the complexity of logistics network. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper examines the spatial and institutional characteristics of inland port development in Latin America, through an analysis of a detailed case study of the port of Veracruz in Mexico. It explores the spatial distribution of seaports and inland ports as well as the issues of customs clearance, rail regulation, cargo security and land acquisition, before discussing conflicting models of development depending on the priorities of inland and port actors. A supplementary aim of the paper is thus to develop a conceptual model of directional development in a geographical context of an emerging economy which traditionally has suffered from the absence of integrated policy frameworks for transport and logistics, leading to a lack of infrastructure investment and several constraints on hinterland accessibility.Findings reveal that port actors (both port authorities and terminal operators) are being proactive in response to a changing transport and logistics environment, in a setting where railway regulation and cargo security play critical roles in establishing hinterland integration. Reform to customs clearance processes is ongoing to allow more effective container flow management between the port and the hinterland, but the major obstacle to implementing an efficient loop is the fragmentation of the rail sector in Mexico. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This paper considers both the access and egress stages as an entire process to analyze the satisfaction levels of commuters with metro commuter journeys. Based on a survey in Nanjing, China, seven intermodal travel groups are employed as targets for this analysis. The groups include Walk-Metro-Walk, Walk-Metro-Bus, Bike-Metro-Walk, Bike-Metro-Bus, Bus-Metro-Walk, Bus-Metro-Bus and Car-Metro-Walk, which are named according to the modes of transportation that are employed for access and egress trips. Binary logit models are developed for each group to identify the main factors of satisfaction level. The results show that access and egress stages serve important but different roles in the seven groups. Facility service qualities in two stages are the primary factors that affect overall satisfaction. The groups with same access or egress modes have significantly different core factors. Access by bike and bike-metro-transit users are concerned with bike parking safety, whereas bike-metro-walk users value parking spaces near metro stations. With two transfers between bus and metro, transit-metro-transit users indicate that the weak point in the access stage is the crowded spaces on buses. However, transit-metro-walk users value bus on-time performance, which is also valued by groups with metro-bus egress transfers. For egress by walking, commuters that use motorized modes for access are concerned with the egress walking environment, whereas users of non-motorized access modes are more concerned with egress walking spaces. The findings of this study are helpful for policy developments than can improve public satisfaction with commutes by urban metro. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Intermodal rail/road transportation is an instrument of green logistics, which may help reducing transport related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In order to assess the environmental impact of road and rail transports, researchers have formulated very detailed microscopic models, which determine vehicle emissions precisely based on a vast number of parameters. They also developed macroscopic models, which estimate emissions more roughly from few parameters that are considered most influential. One of the goals of this paper is to develop mesoscopic models that combine the preciseness of micro-models while requiring only little more information than macro-models. We propose emission models designed for transport planning purposes which are simple to calibrate by transport managers. Despite their compactness, our models are able to reflect the influence of various traffic conditions on a transport's total emissions. Furthermore, contrasting most papers considering either the road or the rail mode, we provide models on a common basis for both modes of transportation. We validate our models using popular micro- and macroscopic models and we apply them to artificial and real world transport scenarios to identify under which circumstances intermodal transports actually effect lower emissions. We find that travel speed and country-specific energy emission factors influence the eco-friendliness of intermodal transports most severely. Hence, the particular route chosen for a transnational intermodal transport is an important but so far neglected option for eco-friendly transportation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Despite the European Union (EU) efforts promoting policies that encourage short sea shipping (SSS) based on its advantages in terms of intermodality and environment, this mode has not yet reached a significant market share compared to land transport. In this paper, we establish a thesis that suggests that funding programs (such as Marco Polo I and II) have not properly offered the right incentives to promote SSS, and aspects such as the key role of port infrastructure and its characteristics, have not been taken into consideration. In a departure from traditional transport cost models, to prove our thesis, we use a theoretical intermodal competition model to compare alternative modes—road transport vs. SSS. We reach the conclusion that the EU needs to focus on ports and transport system efficiency as a whole in order to compete effectively in the freight transport market. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The global economic structure, with its decentralized production and the consequent increase in freight traffic all over the world, creates considerable problems and challenges for the freight transport sector. This situation has led shipping to become the most suitable and cheapest way to transport goods. Thus, ports are configured as nodes with critical importance in the logistics supply chain as a link between two transport systems, sea and land. Increase in activity at seaports is producing three undesirable effects: increasing road congestion, lack of open space in port installations and a significant environmental impact on seaports. These adverse effects can be mitigated by moving part of the activity inland. Implementation of dry ports is a possible solution and would also provide an opportunity to strengthen intermodal solutions as part of an integrated and more sustainable transport chain, acting as a link between road and railway networks. In this sense, implementation of dry ports allows the separation of the links of the transport chain, thus facilitating the shortest possible routes for the lowest capacity and most polluting means of transport. Thus, the decision of where to locate a dry port demands a thorough analysis of the whole logistics supply chain, with the objective of transferring the largest volume of goods possible from road to more energy efficient means of transport, like rail or short-sea shipping, that are less harmful to the environment. However, the decision of where to locate a dry port must also ensure the sustainability of the site. Thus, the main goal of this article is to research the variables influencing the sustainability of dry port location and how this sustainability can be evaluated. With this objective, in this paper we present a methodology for assessing the sustainability of locations by the use of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Bayesian Networks (BNs). MCDA is used as a way to establish a scoring, whilst BNs were chosen to eliminate arbitrariness in setting the weightings using a technique that allows us to prioritize each variable according to the relationships established in the set of variables. In order to determine the relationships between all the variables involved in the decision, giving us the importance of each factor and variable, we built a K2 BN algorithm. To obtain the scores of each variable, we used a complete cartography analysed by ArcGIS. Recognising that setting the most appropriate location to place a dry port is a geographical multidisciplinary problem, with significant economic, social and environmental implications, we consider 41 variables (grouped into 17 factors) which respond to this need. As a case of study, the sustainability of all of the 10 existing dry ports in Spain has been evaluated. In this set of logistics platforms, we found that the most important variables for achieving sustainability are those related to environmental protection, so the sustainability of the locations requires a great respect for the natural environment and the urban environment in which they are framed. © 2015 © 2015 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore the use of lean principles to drive operational improvements in intermodal container facilities. Intermodal terminals have an important role in today’s globally complex supply networks. In the case of bottleneck-derived terminalization, operational issues such as achieving effective material flow remains a significant and common challenge. To assist with such challenges, the paper develops a conceptual framework built on the principles of lean. Design/methodology/approach – In this paper, a theory-building approach is adopted and a lean terminalization framework developed by combining aspects of lean- and intermodal transport theory with practical insights. The framework was developed in conjunction with two intermodal container facilities within the Scandinavian region. Findings – The conceptual framework demonstrates how lean approaches can be used to identify improvement areas, as well as to develop solutions for improved material flow in the context of intermodal transport operations. The framework can be used to guide the lean implementation process in small to medium intermodal container facilities. Research limitations/implications – The development of the framework represents the first stage of a two-stage project. The second stage will involve implementing and empirically testing the framework in the practical settings of the two-case facilities. Practical implications – Lean is a philosophical approach that consists of a set of principles that drive organizations to continually add value to their operations. The application of lean practices enhances necessary process steps and eliminates those that fail to add value, thereby improving material flow and performance. Social implications – Improving the operational efficiency and effectiveness of container terminals out not only assists the profitability of the facilities but also has flow-on benefits for stakeholders, external customers, consumers and the environment. Originality/value – Lean has been successfully applied in manufacturing because the 1990s, and though it has also found relevance in a number of other industries, applications of lean within the intermodal transport sector is limited. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Determining a suitable location for an intermodal terminal is a critical element of the terminal establishment process, a decision on which the functionality of the entire intermodal freight distribution chain depends. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the criteria used for deciding on suitable locations for intermodal terminals in Croatia. First, quality indicators of intermodal terminals were identified: flexibility, safety and security, reliability, time, and accessibility. Based on these quality indicators, and in compliance with the European traffic policy and efficient functioning of intermodal transport, location criteria were formed and evaluated: legislative, environmental, goods flows, spatial, technical-technological, and organizational. Each criterion is divided further into subcriteria and evaluated using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method. The results of the study show that the criterion of goods flows has the most significant impact on the selection of the terminal location, followed by the spatial criterion. A position that connects to the European traffic corridor network is essential for a Croatian terminal's success. © 2015 The Pennsylvania State University.},

abstract={The freight infrastructure network (e.g., roads, railways, waterways, etc.) is the backbone of nearly all trade partnerships in the United States and abroad. The manner in which the individual portions of its constituent parts are interrelated or arranged plays an important role for determining the environmental footprint of goods moved within the network. Herein, we compare the spatial distribution of potential consumer-producer exchanges (i.e., accessibility) under varying greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets or preferences for minimal transportation-related GHG emissions. We conduct case studies using two freight modes (truck and intermodal rail) for two representative commodities: meat/seafood and paper articles. Results across all counties in the United States indicate that the geographic area in which trade is possible, given a GHG budget, varies by transportation mode, location, and commodity. Our results suggest that intermodal terminal availability is an important determinant of low-GHG accessibility. Since only a fraction of road-to-rail terminals accommodate meat/seafood (4.9%) and paper (0.7%), the United States could increase its expected GHG savings associated with truck-to-rail mode-switching policies by 70% (+20 kg CO2,e/ton for meat/seafood) and 310% (+30 kg CO2,e/ton for paper) by upgrading current terminals to allow the exchange of all types of goods. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Increased global container trade and strong competition are boosting the need for efficient container terminals. Using internal transport resources efficiently reduces transfer times and operating costs. This article addresses the allocation of straddle carriers at a tactical level at intermodal container terminals via optimization and simulation. Our objective is to reduce overall delays at the terminal—with special focus on delays of inland transport modes (rail, road and waterway). We introduce a notation to describe different service strategies and delay criteria and analyze the complexity of different service strategies. A generic mixed integer linear program—that can be easily adapted to different service strategies—models the allocation problem based on a network flow representation of the terminal. We conduct a case study for a container terminal at the Grand Port Maritime de Marseille to evaluate the proposed allocation: we adapt the optimization model to the specific terminal, implement a discrete event simulation model and conduct experiments on actual data. Results show that the allocation proposed by the optimization model reduces delays at the terminal and performs well in a stochastic environment. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={This study has dual research objectives: 1) to evaluate the land use characteristics of the pedestrian catchment areas (PCA) of subway stations in the Seoul metropolitan area (SMA) in terms of transit-oriented development (TOD) principles and 2) to investigate the influence of each PCA's land use characteristics on station-level ridership. The major findings can be summarized as follows. First, the built environments of subway PCAs in Seoul were found to be compatible with TOD principles in terms of density and diversity. They have declining density gradients of population and employment that extend outward from a station and have a high level of mixed-use land.Second, population and employment densities, land use mix diversity, and intermodal connectivity all have a positive impact on subway ridership, but differ in their spatial ranges. In particular, the influence spans of residential and commercial development patterns (population density and the proportion of commercial land) and mixed land use on ridership were limited to only the core and primary PCAs. Consequently, with respect to TOD in a compact city like Seoul, we recommend that a PCA be defined to encompass a radius of 600 m. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={During the CHARLEX campaign in the Galápagos Islands, a Scanning Particle Mobility Sizer was deployed on San Cristobal Island in July-August 2011 to carry out size-resolved measurements of the concentration of submicron aerosols. To our knowledge these are the first measurements of aerosol concentrations in this unique environment. The particles with marine origin displayed a tri-modal number size distribution with peak diameters of 0.016 μm, 0.050 μm and 0.174 μm and a cloud-processed intermodal minimum at 0.093 μm. The mean total aerosol number concentration for the marine contribution was 470 ± 160 cm-3. A low particle concentration of 70 ± 50 cm-3 for the nucleation size range was measured, but no evidence of new particle production in the atmospheric marine boundary layer (MBL) was observed. The concentration of the Aitken size mode was found to be related to aerosol entrainment from the free troposphere off the coast of Chile followed by transport within the MBL to the Galápagos Islands. Cloud processing may activate the particles in the Aitken size range, growing through 'in-cloud' sulphate production and increasing the particle concentration in the accumulation size range. The 0.093 μm cloud processed minima suggests that the critical supersaturation at which the particle is activated to a cloud droplet is in the 0.14-0.21% range. The daytime marine particle background concentration was influenced by human activity around the sampling site, as well as by new particle formation triggered by biogenic emissions from the vegetation cover of the island's semiarid lowlands. Effective CCN formation may play a role in the formation and properties of the stratus clouds, which permanently cover the top of the windward side of the islands and establish one of their characteristic climatic bands. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency (CREATE) Program is a nationally prominent rail-infrastructure program. It is managed by the unique partnership of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), the State of Illinois, the City of Chicago, Metra, Amtrak, Association of American Railroads, and six of the nation's Class I freight railroads. The CREATE 75th Street Corridor Improvement Project (CIP) received a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) Record of Decision in September 2014. As a result of 75th Street CIP and other completed preliminary engineering and project environmental reviews within the 70 rail-improvements program, CREATE has set a national-policy example with regard to mitigation under the environmental justice Executive Order (EO) 12898. This article provides some background on the CREATE Program and examines the development of the CREATE Environmental Justice Policy. It describes the impetus for creating the policy, namely noise impacts on low-income and minority populations resulting from the 75 th Street CIP and other CREATE Program rail projects. This article also discusses the extensive coordination among Federal and State agencies, among the public and private CREATE partners, and among Community Advisory Groups and residents, all of which led to the specific mitigations addressed in the CREATE environmental justice policy. The result of these encompassing efforts, led by Federal Highway Administration and the Illinois Department of Transportation's Division of Public and Intermodal Transportation, is a precedent-setting framework for analyzing and, when necessary, mitigating the potential environmental justice impacts of the CREATE Program rail projects. The CREATE Environmental Justice Policy is precedent setting in a few ways: (a) it establishes policy where none currently exists and where existing highway-oriented policies do not seem appropriate or applicable; (b) it provides greater specificity with regard to what mitigation measures are practicable to address predicted noise impacts of CREATE Program rail projects on low-income and minority populations; (c) it clarifies the lead agencies' intent to maintain the transportation linkage and focus when developing and evaluating practicable mitigation measures for other (i.e., non-noise) impacts; and (d) it helps assure the equity of the transportation investment by better balancing the distribution of burdens and benefits at the project level. This article identifies the steps, when considering disproportionately high and adverse impacts to low-income and/or minority populations, on how to evaluate other practicable mitigation measures with merit under EO 12898. This article also describes the lessons learned and the dialogue necessary to receive broad support from the CREATE partners for both needed rail improvements and additional mitigations to provide offsetting benefits and opportunities to enhance Chicago-area communities, neighborhoods, and residents' quality of life. © National Association of Environmental Professionals 2015.},

abstract={Intermodal freight transportation refers to a multi-modal chain of container-transportation services which usually links the initial shipper to the final consignee of the container (door-to-door service) and takes place over long distances. Container transportation is a major component of intermodal transportation and international commerce. Container flow should be optimal to ensure proper resource utilization and profitability to players. Various multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have been developed to efficiently solve optimization problems in container flows. This paper presents a short review of optimization problems in intermodal transport using sea and land legs together regarding three mostly observed objectives (transport cost, transit time and CO2 emissions). © Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Belgrade.

abstract={Given the inherent limitations of state-financed infrastruc-tural development, it is unrealistic to keep looking towards the government in emerging economies to fund the much needed restructuring of their transportation segment. With the Indian Railways facing an unchecked decline in freight transport mix, this study examines the politically romanticized 'public good' nature of Indian Railways to elaborate the need for a modal shift in policy for achieving sustainable transportation. Based on the analysis of historic data, the projected modal split in freight transport is modelled through two scenarios. The business as usual scenario indicated continued preference by the industry for road-based cargo movement. Although the government's National Transport Development Policy Committee calls for increased investment in rail infrastructure and technologies to reach the targeted modal split of 50:50 by 2030 it fails to elaborate where, and who, will finance this venture. This communication thus calls for the privatization of the Indian rail-freight shipment through vertical integration and sub-networks creation. Arguments are supported by scrutinizing past inter-modal shifts in demographically similar Latin American countries.},

abstract={An increasing number of logistics service providers act as freight integrators in offering one-stop solutions to customers in recent years. Most mathematical models of intermodal network design have been developed with a single objective of cost minimisation. This study focuses on developing innovative approaches in the area of enhanced intermodal network design provided by freight integrators. The overall aim of this paper is to demonstrate an original optimisation model that can be employed by freight integrators to address cost minimisation, transit time minimisation, and carbon footprint to better meet market needs. To achieve the aim, this paper develops a bi-objective optimisation model to minimise cost and transit time for the tactical planning of intermodal container flows with constrained carbon emission. The results and analysis of the example of China offer practical insights on the impact of trade-offs between cost and transit time, and the effect of different carbon emission restrictions on intermodal network design. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={In the recent past, emerging regions of the world have become significant contributors in powering growth of the global economy. The regions have experienced increase in foreign direct investment, rise in volumes of exports and imports, and an increase in shipping lines towards such regions. Africa in this trend has not been left behind with the IMF reporting that six out of ten fastest growing economies in the world are found in Africa. Specifically, East Africa is one of the regions that have experienced this positive trend relating to more integration of the economies, high average GDP growth, and tremendous increase in international freight destined for overseas and inland through the ports of Mombasa and Dares Salaam. The rise in freight volume however, has resulted into port terminal capacity and productivity challenges, congestion along transport corridors, damage of highways, traffic jam in port cities and environmental pollution hence making the nature of growth and development expensive and unsustainable. This conceptual paper therefore tries to propose the adoption of the 'extended gateway concept 'to be integrated into East Africa's transportation-logistics system in order to manage and prevent supply chain related disruptions related to time,costs,reliability and safety .The paper presents a theoretical meaning of the concept, discusses the logistical challenges of East Africa from a shipping perspective, and proposes a 'Three tier' Extended gateway model for the region based on the development of inland intermodal terminals or dry ports to achieve a modern, economically and environmentally sustainable fright transportation system. © (2016) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to outline the role of organizational and cultural tools to increase supply chain security within the intermodal rail and road industry. Three main research questions are set, regarding: what organizational and cultural tools are used by companies within the intermodal rail and road industry; how these tools impact on security performance; and what environmental factors trigger the use of each tool. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 13 companies within the intermodal rail and road industry have been studied in detail through in-depth case studies. Findings - Results suggest that organizational and cultural tools impact positively on supply chain security, by reducing collusion and both operative and planning mistakes. In particular, such tools mitigate the effect of lack of cooperation and communication between partners and of inadequate partners. Practical implications - Results point out that the ability of organizational and cultural tools to increase supply chain security has not been fully exploited yet. Tools to mitigate the negative effects on security of inadequacy of partners are not popular or they are not considered as powerful enough, despite it has been highlighted as the most relevant causal factor of lack of security. Originality/value - This paper introduces a thorough overview of the effects of cultural and organizational tools on supply chain security and a detailed study of these tools in the area of intermodal rail-and-road transport. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Currently, container shipping development is directly associated with an increase of warehouse areas for containers' storage. One of the most successful types of container terminal is an intermodal terminal called a dry port. Main pollution sources during the organization of intermodal transport are considered. A system of dry port parameters, which are recommended for the evaluation of different scenarios for a seaport infrastructure development at the stage of its strategic planning, is proposed in this paper. The authors have developed a method for determining the optimal values of the main dry port parameters by simulation modeling in the programming software Any-Logic. Dependencies thatwere obtained as a result of modeling experiments prove the adequacy of main selected dry port parameters for the effective scenarios' evaluation of throughput and handling capacity at existing seaports at the stage of strategic planning and a rational dry port location, allowed ensuring the improvement of the ecological situation in a port city. © 2016 D.

abstract={Rail reforms are aimed at increasing the share of rail in a country's or region's modal split through an efficiency improvement in railway operations, a stimulation of intra- and inter-modal competition and an increased financial accountability and sustainability of the railway company. The recent approaches to railway institutional change in the leading economies of the world was guided by deregulation and liberalization of railway transport. Rail reform in the European Union aimed at a more open market and a clear division of roles between infrastructure managers and railway operators is well documented. The reforms taking place elsewhere in Europe received less attention. This paper deals with the reform of the Ukrainian Railways taking into account the difficult economic, political, social and financial environment the country is in.We analyzed the processes of institutional change in Ukraine and the effectiveness of this institutional change for the development of Ukrainian Railways. Theoretical concepts from institutional economics were applied to map how railway administration and railway players modify existing institutional arrangements to their interests.The analysis in this paper demonstrates the place-dependent nature of changes in the institutional-organizational framework for the rail sector. The case of Ukrainian Railways supports this notion. Ukraine presents a unique case given the path dependence created by its former Soviet history, the great significance of rail in the national transport network and the role of industrial tycoons in cargo generation. We believe railway transport in Ukraine should not be exposed to shock reforms given its great importance to the national economy. However, further changes in the Ukrainian Railways institutional framework are needed to fit even better into the economic realities. We propose specific recommendations for the rail institutional framework adjustments in Ukraine. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Intermodal freight transportation is concerned with the shipment of commodities from their origin to destination using combinations of transport modes. Traditional logistics models have concentrated on minimizing transportation costs by appropriately determining the service network and the transportation routing. This paper considers an intermodal transportation problem with an explicit consideration of greenhouse gas emissions and intermodal transfers. A model is described which is in the form of a non-linear integer programming formulation, which is then linearized. A hypothetical but realistic case study of the UK including eleven locations forms the test instances for our investigation, where uni-modal with multi-modal transportation options are compared using a range of fixed costs. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={This paper develops a model that enables comparative analysis of intermodal and synchromodal operations from economic, societal, and environmental perspectives. The model captures relevant (day-to-day and within-day) dynamics in freight transport demand and supply, flexible multimodal routing with transfers and transhipments. The capacitated schedule-based assignment algorithm operating specifically at path level allows strategic modelling and evaluation accounting for the freight transport system at operational level. The Rotterdam hinterland container transport case study shows that synchromodal system is likely to improve transport service level, capacity utilization, and modal shift, but not to reduce delivery costs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This study examines metro passengers who use intermodal transfer service during their metro system and bus travel and develops research hypotheses based on the perceived value theory. The intentions of potential and retained passengers to use intermodal transfer are influenced by the different amounts of information they possess as well as potential intermodal transfer penalties and benefits (perceived value and free bus transfer). Thus, this study adopts the information processing theory to investigate such behavior intentions and to derive various market segmentation strategies between potential and retained passengers concerning their transfer service use. We also look at the interrelationships between the two main constructs, transfer penalties and benefits, and adopt structural equation modeling to test our hypotheses. The analytical results show that perceived transfer penalties, perceived values, and free bus transfer all influence metro-bus transfer intentions. Perceived value is the most essential determinant of behavioral intention among all the other attributes related to transit transfer in this study and can mediate the relationship between free bus transfer and transfer intentions. The study's conclusions have managerial implications for metro system and bus system agencies and may be applied to intermodal transfer services in other transportation industries. Perceived value of metro-bus transfer service usage can possibly be elevated through the following measures: timetable coordination between metro and bus agencies, passenger guidance information, comfortable bus shelters and waiting environment provisions, low-floor bus services, and smart card integration between the metro and buses. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In the context of increasing threats to the sensitive marine ecosystem by toxic metals, this study investigated the metal build-up on impervious surfaces specific to commercial seaports. The knowledge generated from this study will contribute to managing toxic metal pollution of the marine ecosystem. The study found that inter-modal operations and main access roadway had the highest loads followed by container storage and vehicle marshalling sites, while the quay line and short term storage areas had the lowest. Additionally, it was found that Cr, Al, Pb, Cu and Zn were predominantly attached to solids, while significant amount of Cu, Pb and Zn were found as nutrient complexes. As such, treatment options based on solids retention can be effective for some metal species, while ineffective for other species. Furthermore, Cu and Zn are more likely to become bioavailable in seawater due to their strong association with nutrients. Mathematical models to replicate the metal build-up process were also developed using experimental design approach and partial least squares regression. The models for Cr and Pb were found to be reliable, while those for Al, Zn and Cu were relatively less reliable, but could be employed for preliminary investigations. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Rail yards are important nodes in the freight transportation network. However, they are also a focus of public health concern when located in highly populated areas. Field characterization of near-rail yard air quality is challenging due to spatially- and temporally-variable emissions. Numerical models can provide valuable insight into factors affecting emission dispersion and resulting near-field air pollution. This study utilizes computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to investigate near-field air pollution surrounding a generic, moderate-sized intermodal rail yard with emissions of a neutrally buoyant gaseous pollutant. Rail yard and surrounding neighborhood structures were added in succession to a base case to study the influence of surface roughness on the generic pollutant's spatial concentration profile. A spatially weighted emissions scenario revealed highly variable pollutant levels in downwind neighborhoods, strongly affected by wind direction. Rail yard topography resulted in a modest increase in near-field pollution levels. Densely located two-story homes surrounding the rail yard reduced downwind concentrations by 16% and 15% at 25 m and 100 m downwind of the rail yard boundary, respectively. A 6 m boundary wall surrounding the rail yard, with four open sections enabling traffic flow, reduced downwind pollution levels by 25% and 12% at 25 m and 100 m downwind, respectively. While average pollution levels were lower with the addition of neighborhoods and a surrounding boundary wall, high spatial variability in pollution levels resulted in some near-field areas experiencing increased pollution that are offset by reductions in other areas. © 2015 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse vertical integration in the rail sector using a combination of transaction cost economics (TCE), the resource-based view (RBV) and the relational view, through which rail wagons are viewed as "relationship specific assets". Design/methodology/approach - The empirical analysis is based on a cross-case comparison of four case studies of intermodal operators in Europe, each exhibiting different levels of collaboration and integration between terminals, operators and sub-contractors. Findings - Viewing rail wagons as relationship specific assets rather than merely transaction specific (TCE) or firm specific (RBV) demonstrates that wagon ownership is not only a good indicator of the level of vertical cooperation but of the existence of trust and learning within a collaborative environment. Practical implications - The organisational setup is not derived purely from transaction or resource characteristics, but by the integration of processes through the purchase of assets that will be used to produce a service, with the expected levels of trust and commitment. In this sense, the role of the wagon as a relationship specific asset is a microcosm of the key elements of a successful intermodal transport system. Originality/value - As one of the key operational aspects of the rail sector is the use of expensive equipment and the relative responsibility for fixed and moveable assets, an analysis of the use of rail wagons as relationship specific assets allows a more dynamic understanding of vertical integration in the rail sector than currently provided by TCE or RBV alone. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={A sequential measurement method is demonstrated for quantifying the variability in exposure concentration during public transportation. This method was applied in Hong Kong by measuring PM2.5 and CO concentrations along a route connecting 13 transportation-related microenvironments within 3-4 h. The study design takes into account ventilation, proximity to local sources, area-wide air quality, and meteorological conditions. Portable instruments were compacted into a backpack to facilitate measurement under crowded transportation conditions and to quantify personal exposure by sampling at nose level. The route included stops next to three roadside monitors to enable comparison of fixed site and exposure concentrations. PM2.5 exposure concentrations were correlated with the roadside monitors, despite differences in averaging time, detection method, and sampling location. Although highly correlated in temporal trend, PM2.5 concentrations varied significantly among microenvironments, with mean concentration ratios versus roadside monitor ranging from 0.5 for MTR train to 1.3 for bus terminal. Measured inter-run variability provides insight regarding the sample size needed to discriminate between microenvironments with increased statistical significance. The study results illustrate the utility of sequential measurement of microenvironments and policy-relevant insights for exposure mitigation and management. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The use of solid biofuel for energy in heating plants has increased drastically during the last decades. This substantial and increasing demand has placed focus on delivering biofuel to the plants, as logistics issues are considered one of the key challenges for further increased use of biofuel. Problems in sourcing enough fuel locally due to the increasing size of power plants and environmental concerns has sparked an interest in using multimodal road-rail transport as a cost effective and environmentally friendly way of long-haul transport. A case study is performed at a Swedish district heating plant to investigate the potential of introducing multimodal transport. Extensive calculations are performed in the design and operation of a multimodal system, showing both costs and CO2 emissions. This is analysed in relation to key logistical challenges in the industry. A best case scenario is identified. Conclusions are that the potential for multimodal transport is greatest among the largest plants with large volumes to achieve high resource utilisation of the transport equipment. A shift from road to multimodal transport is facilitated by that a large share of the current road transport flows already pass through a terminal, which improves multimodal transport competitiveness against road transport as this reduced the cost difference. This study leads to better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of multimodal biofuel transport and has practical implications for anyone in the process of designing such systems. © 2016, Editorial Board EJTIR.

abstract={Shipping containers are manufactured exceedingly rigid and strong complying specifications for freight purposes. After ending freight spell at sea and road, shipping containers are just occupying huge spaces at ports and other places. Among all the reuses, the recent technology and construction practices have set the containers for home building purposes. This research investigates the recent usage of containers for home buildings, and determines its constructability in Australian building industry. It also investigates the effects of carbon footprint and other life cycle environmental impacts (LCEI). Life cycle assessment (LCA) approach was used to evaluate 6 LCEI category indicators: cumulative energy demand (CED), water use, solid waste, global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential, and eutrophication potential. A container-framed house is used as the base case to compare with other previous studies to evaluate the differences in those LCEI. According to Building Code Australia, the container house was complied with 6-star energy rating. Results show that operation phase has the most dominating impact for all the indicators except water use and solid waste generation. For all the impact categories, the overall contributions of the whole life cycle impacts have increased significantly if the design life of a building is increased to 100 years. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to compare improvement actions for reducing transport's impact on climate from the shipper's perspective. To that end, it introduces an evaluation tool for comparing improvement actions in transport systems in terms of transport costs, impact on climate, and barriers to implementation. Within the context of five international flows involving a food producer, three actions—namely, engaging intermodal transport, increasing load factors by double-stacking pallets, and using high-capacity vehicles—were evaluated. Shipment data were collected to calculate reductions in transport costs and impact on climate, whereas interviews with the food producer were conducted to identify barriers. Results showed that reductions in transport costs and impact on climate attributed to the improvement actions differed among the five flows. Engaging intermodal transport reduced the system's impact on climate by 27–53%, double-stacking pallets by 0–23%, and using high-capacity vehicles by 7–15%, with differences primarily due to different freight densities. Concerning barriers to implementation, the improvement actions also varied by flow. Altogether, unlike other papers, which have examined improvement actions separately, this paper offers an evaluation tool for comparing several improvement actions at once, as applied to a particular empirical case. Shippers with multiple flows and several possible improvement actions can use the evaluation tool to efficiently reduce their systems’ impact on climate. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Growing importance of intermodal transportation necessitates modeling and solving load planning problems by taking into account various complex decisions simultaneously like transportation mode/service type selection, load allocation, and outsourcing. This paper presents a mixed-integer mathematical programming model for a multi-objective, multi-mode and multi-period sustainable load planning problem by considering import/export load flows to satisfy transport demands of customers and many other related issues. Several multiple objective optimization procedures are utilized in order to handle conflicting objectives simultaneously under crisp and fuzzy decision making environments. A real-life case study is also performed to present application and usefulness of the proposed model. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In a more and more competitive and global world, freight transports have to overcome increasingly long distances while at the same time becoming more reliable. In addition, a raising awareness of the need for environmentally friendly solutions increases the importance of transportation modes other than road. Intermodal transportation, in that regard, allows for the combination of different modes in order to exploit their individual advantages. Intermodal transportation networks offer flexible, robust and environmentally friendly alternatives to transport high volumes of goods over long distances. In order to reflect these advantages, it is the challenge to develop models which both represent multiple modes and their characteristics (e.g., fixed-time schedules and routes) as well as the transhipment between these transportation modes. In this paper, we introduce a Green Intermodal Service Network Design Problem with Travel Time Uncertainty (GISND-TTU) for combined offline intermodal routing decisions of multiple commodities. The proposed stochastic approach allows for the generation of robust transportation plans according to different objectives (i.e., cost, time and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions) by considering uncertainties in travel times as well as demands with the help of the sample average approximation method. The proposed methodology is applied to a real-world network, which shows the advantages of stochasticity in achieving robust transportation plans. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Scholars, practitioners and activists have been reconsidering the importance of cycling to create sustainable transport systems. A discussion of intermodal transport invites us to reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of diverse modes, as they relate to strategic planning decisions and particularly land use, along with considering ways that cities could get more out of these synergies. Thinking about cycling and buses in terms of intermodality in cities and metropolitan regions also invites reflection on the nature of a “sustainable” transport system: Is it enough to contest the “mono-mode” of the car simply by replacing it with another mono-mode, public transport, or would it be useful to think in terms of “ecologies of diverse modes”, able to respond to different needs, budgets, and people? Could bike-bus systems become the main articulators of sustainable cities in the 21st century? What advantages would this offer in terms of land use, health, inclusion and other social benefits? This study examines these issues in the context of democratizing governance systems that include strong, collaborative types of citizen participation, which can help to overcome often fragmented urban governance systems, and build toward more integrated, sustainability-oriented transport and urban systems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={An environmental noise model, developed in specialist software such as LimA, SoundPLAN or CadnaA is typically at the core of noise impact assessments for rail projects. These software packages include rail noise modules that account for such variables as train speed and length, and propagation algorithms that allow large scale models to reliably predict noise levels at thousands of receivers neighbouring the track. The ease with which results are generated by these software packages can easily provide a false sense of accuracy however, as the old maxim of noise modelling still applies - garbage in equals garbage out. This is particularly the case for freight rail operations which involve complex noise sources. These include multiple moving noise sources, such as locomotive exhaust noise and rolling noise, that exhibit distinct relationships with train speed. There are localised sources such as crossovers and curve noise which have a particularly annoying character. There are sources that exhibit different characteristics under different operational scenarios. For example locomotive noise can be dominated by the engine exhaust under traction on an uphill grade and ruled by dynamic brake noise on a downhill grade. This paper presents a discussion of issues to be considered to successfully model freight rail noise. It describes the different noise sources which apply, when they apply and how to incorporate them in a computer noise model. An outline is provided on the most appropriate propagation algorithms to apply and how sources such as curve noise and brake noise, can be accounted for. Attention is also given to validation of the noise model at each stage of its development, including how to make best use of noise measurements to verify model predictions. Introduction This paper is intended to summarise the key issues that may need to be considered when modelling the noise impacts of freight railways. It assumes the reader has existing knowledge of one or more specialist noise modelling software packages, such as LimA, SoundPLAN or CadnaA. This paper concentrates on modelling operational freight rail noise on network or main line track. It does not consider issues associated with modelling noise during project construction, or the noise from freight classification yards, stabling areas or intermodal terminals. This paper describes the process of developing a freight rail noise model, and standard methods and approaches that should be employed to maintain quality and consistency between projects. The context of the paper is modelling rail freight noise in NSW. The paper is arranged in a series of steps corresponding to the stages of model development as follows: Modelling accuracy Input data collection (databases, measurements, train numbers, speeds) Choice of software, rail noise standards, algorithms and assessment settings Geometry modelling (terrain, barriers, receivers, ground, model extent) Rail noise sources (wheel-rail, locomotive exhaust, idling, curving, turnouts) Modelling scenarios (day, night, existing, future, mitigated) Checking and review Model validation and compliance measurements.},

abstract={This paper undertakes the assessment of the bus transport systems of two port cities in the Caribbean, the BRT system Transmetro in Barranquilla, and Metrobus, a ‘light’ BRT system, in Panama City. Although the systems have different contexts, design and operational characteristics, they have in common that over the last years their service quality has deteriorated, leading to negative users' perception and consequently decrease in patronage levels. Understanding these problematic factors is key for the mobility of these cities as they are both planning to expand their systems and consolidate multi-modal integrated transport systems in the upcoming years. Through a series of interviews with several stakeholders from institutions related to the mobility sector in each city our analysis identifies aspects of conceptual design, planning and implementation of institutional, operational, financial and management frameworks that might have been preventing the systems from achieving a better performance. Moreover, our analysis highlights two factors embedded at the core of the systems' difficulties: First, BRT technology transfer with limited understanding of context and little adaptation to local user's expectations and preferences; and second, design criteria that address financial requirements at the expense of quality of service for people's needs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Intermodal transportation has known a great development during last decades as consequence to the development of container transportation services but also because of its sustainability advantages. The development of gateways infrastructures (ports, air ports) but also the extension of gateway concept to dry ports leads to the development of hinterland logistics networks that requires efforts and researches to optimize the design and the configuration of both their infrastructures and their services. The design, configuration and the service network design of a system(network) performing hinterland logistics, obeys to the same objectives as for a transportation and /or distribution network but could differ because of either its specific structure, cost function and/or specific constraints related to the actors points of view. To be cost effective and mitigate the negative environmental and human health effects of distribution operations of road mode, hinterland freight logistics systems should be intermodal by integrating more and more rail and land waterway traffic. The planning of these systems at tactical level, deserve more attention because a great deal of cost effectiveness could be reached at this level. The purpose of this paper is to address a modeling framework for service network design for a based dry ports hinterland logistics system. The models are based on a path fixed charged capacitated formulation and give as outcomes shipping frequencies by service class of each path and by the way the required capacity in gateways and the intermodal dry ports. © 2005 - 2016 JATIT & LLS.

abstract={Purpose: Transport is the European Union (EU) sector that produces the second highest amount of greenhouse gas emissions. In its attempts to promote the environmentally sustainable development of transport, the EU has focussed on intermodal transport in particular – but with limited success. It is important to understand how freight transport is selected, which criteria are used and what role environmental sustainability and intermodal transport play in the selection. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to focus on the role of environmental sustainability and intermodal transport in transport mode decisions. The authors look at this issue from the perspective of logistics service providers (LSPs) and buyers, as they are important stakeholders in guiding this process. Design/methodology/approach: To gain a holistic view of the current state of research, the authors have conducted a systematic literature review of the role of environmental sustainability and intermodal transport in transport mode decisions. The authors have further examined the findings concerning requests for quotations (RfQs), tenders and transport contracts, as these are also linked to decisions on transport choice. Findings: The findings from the literature review include the results of descriptive and structured content analysis of the selected articles. They show that the discussion on environmental sustainability and intermodal transport as a sustainable mode, together with the transport mode selection criteria, RfQs/tenders and transport contracts, is still a rather new and emerging topic in the literature. The main focus related to the selection of transport mode has been on utility and cost efficiency, and only recently have issues such as environmental sustainability and intermodal transport started to gain greater attention. The findings also indicate that the theoretical lenses most typically used have been preference models and total cost theories, although the theoretical base has recently become more diversified. Research limitations/implications: There is still a need to extend the theoretical and methodological base, which could then lead to innovative theory building and testing. Such diverse application of methodologies will help in understanding how environmental sustainability can be better linked to mode choice decisions. Practical implications: The findings will be of interest to policy makers and companies opting for environmentally sustainable transport solutions. Social implications: If the EU, shippers and LSPs take a more active stance in promoting environmentally sustainable transformation models, this will have long-lasting societal impacts. Originality/value: It seems that this systematic literature review of the topic is one of the first such attempts in the current body of literature. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The conventional intermodal freight transportation system lacks the needed flexibility, efficiency and effectiveness among other things. The search for more sustainable system for maritime-hinterland transportation has culminated in the development of the synchromodality concept. In this study, mathematical model is formulated and used to experiment the feasibility and applicability of the concept of synchromodality in Ghana. Data for the numerical analysis for the given corridor is obtained from online sources and through the direct interview of experts in the field. Coupled with this, expert judgment of the researchers is also used. The results of the optimisation were plotted in a graph using OriginPro 9.0, 32-Bit Software. From the study results, the synchromodal service design yielded a difference of about 22% cost savings compared with the unimodal service due to the usage of fewer of trucks. The waiting penalty at the terminal of origin is also considerably reduced. When compared with the intermodal service, the synchromodal service offered a cost savings of about 8%.The results of this research show that the innovative concept has the potentials of ensuring sustainability, flexibility and cost reduction among other things, in freight transportation sector. The sustainability is obtained through better modal split and parallel use of modes for maritime-hinterland freight transportation. Furthermore, the study reveals that synchromodality has the potentials of increasing transport service utilisation. The benefits of environmental sustainability are achieved through less usage of trucks resulting in a reduction in environmental pollution, road congestion, noise, etc. © 2018 The Author(s).

abstract={The starting point of this article is the weak usage of rail freight in Belgium and Europe, both as a sustainable mode of land transportation in itself as well as a part of the intermodal chain. The results are obtained by transversal research on rail freight transport in Belgium, taking into account the European context. This interdisciplinary research develops a road map for the creation of three integrated scenarios: a best case, medium case and worst case scenario for rail freight development, based on a detailed SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunities, threats) analysis. It includes the most probable future developments for rail freight transport and hinterland connections. These developments are obtained from literature review and discussions with a heterogeneous panel of experts in the fields of (i) optimal corridor and hub development, (ii) macroeconomic impact, (iii) sustainability, (iv) effective market regulation and (v) governance and organization for a well-functioning intermodality. The Delphi approach is used in combination with a survey analysis. Frequency tables and the H-index allow defining a ranking and selection of SWOT elements. The obtained scenarios allow future research to quantify and measure the impact of future developments and decisions towards the Belgian rail freight market. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={The paper deals with intermodal transportation, broadly defined as a chain consisting of several transportation modes that are coordinated and interact in intermodal terminals to ensure door-to-door service. The goal of the article is to describe the road-sea intermodal flow, to define the responsibilities of each party of a transportation chain and to identify important issues and bottlenecks in the whole intermodal transportation. Recently, the demand for the transportation of dangerous goods has been rising. Transport of dangerous goods can have serious effects on the environment if an accident happens. The legal environment for each transport department, harmonisation of the rules and regulations for intermodal transportation and setting the responsibilities for every party of the transportation chain (such as forwarder, hauler, shipper and consignor) make the transports of dangerous goods more safe and efficient and can reduce risks and threats.},

abstract={The current weaknesses of the conventional intermodal freight transportation system have led to the development of the synchromodal freight transportation concept introduced and piloted in the Netherlands. The innovative concept has the advantage of adding flexibility, cost reduction, and sustainability among other things, into the freight transportation system. The synchromodal system has not been started in any developing country yet due to its newness. In this study, we used multiple methodologies to conduct a feasibility study for the possibilities of introducing the concept in a developing country, Ghana. An intensive literature review was performed using the Grounded Theory and the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) method to identify the key factors for the introduction of the synchromodal concept. Questionnaires were administered to the primary stakeholders in the maritime-hinterland transportation sector to solicit their views about the factors necessary for the implementation. We next carried out SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis to catalogue the strengths and weakness of the country in introducing the concept. The multiple regression analysis method was used to analyse the experience of stakeholders in the freight transportation business and their knowledge about the synchromodal freight transportation system. The results of the study show that it is possible to introduce the concept in the country. However, there is the need to improve the current transportation and ports infrastructure of the country considerably for successful synchromodal system adaptation. There is also the need for stakeholders education on the concept. © 2017 The Author(s). This open access article is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) 4.0 license.},

abstract={Purpose - Decision making in logistics is an increasingly complex task for organizations as these involve decisions at strategic, tactical and operational levels coupled with the triple-bottom line of sustainability. Decision support systems (DSS) played a vital role in arguably solving the challenges associated with decision making in sustainable logistics. The purpose of this paper is to explore the current state of the research in the domain of DSS for logistics while considering sustainability aspects. Design/methodology/approach - A systematic review approach using a set of relevant keywords with several exclusion criteria was adopted to identify literature related to DSS for sustainable logistics. A total of 40 papers were found from 1994 to 2015, which were then analyzed along the dimensions of publishing trend, geographic distribution and collaboration, the most influential journals, affiliations and authors as well as the key themes of identified literature. The analysis was conducted by means of bibliometric and text mapping tools, namely BibExcel, gpsvisualizer and VOSviewer. Findings - The bibliometric analysis showed that DSS for sustainable logistics is an emerging field; however, it is still evolving but at a slower pace. Furthermore, most of the contributing affiliations belong to the USA and the UK. The text mining and keyword analysis revealed key themes of identified papers. The inherent key themes were decision models and frameworks to address sustainable logistics issues covering transport, distribution and third-party logistics. The most prominent sustainable logistics issue was carbon footprinting. Social impact has been given less attention in comparison to economic and environmental aspects. The literature has adequate room for proposing more effective solutions by considering various types of multi-criteria decision analysis methods and DSS configurations while simultaneously considering economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainable logistics. Moreover, the field has potential to include logistics from wide application areas including freight transport through road, rail, sea, air as well as inter-modal transport, port operations, material handling and warehousing. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first systematic review of DSS for sustainable logistics using bibliometric and text analysis. The key themes and research gaps identified in this paper will provide a reference point that will encourage and guide interested researchers for future study, thus aiding both theoretical and practical advancements in this discipline.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to investigate how the integration of new forms of sustainable control systems (SCSs) and traditional management control systems (MCSs), and the use of these control systems affect the integration of sustainability within organizational strategy. A qualitative case study based on a longitudinal investigation of an Italian family firm operating in an environment-sensitive context, the intermodal transport industry, has been used to trace the company's pathway to sustainability integration based on the Gond et al. framework. The paper enriches the Gond et al. conceptualization providing evidence of the external and internal factors relevant in affecting the organization's pathway towards sustainability integration. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the present study is the first analysis that investigates the integration of sustainability into organizational strategy in the context of family firms, from the point of view of performance management systems (PMSs). © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={The port systems have been identified as major energy consumers. They represent the systems that have difficulty in the adaption of innovative solutions with regard to energy savings and energy efficiency. The most of port systems are using the outdated technology for the measurement of energy consumption and because of the mentioned facts they do not contribute to energy efficiency, environmental protection and sustainable development. On the contrary, seaports are one of the main drivers of the pressure on the environment, especially because of the fact that most of the seaports and terminals are located close to the urban areas (city areas). This paper presents the proposals relevant for the transformation of seaports into environmental friendly ports, based on the “GREEN PORT” DEVELOPMENT project proposal, which is submitted by the Intermodal Transport Cluster (Croatia), on Adriatic-Ionian Programme INTERREG V-B Transnational 2014-2020. Some proposals require advanced technology and resources, while others, such as, thimplementation of the so called model of “Green Port” development do not require any special skills. These proposals represent a small contribution to the great effort to energy efficiency, environment protection and sustainable development. © Faculty of Maritime Studies Rijeka, 2017.},

abstract={Purpose: This research examines factors that determine the improvement of the Russian supply chain sustainability. The strategic business model incorporates ecological, social and economic aspects. Design/methodology/approach: Considering Trans-Siberian Railway as a typical case, the study selected several cases or the parts of the primary rail connection with the affiliation of important neighbouring countries. The study uses quantitative analyses of a variety of size parameters (e.g. volumes of traffic, logistics costs, delivery distance and air pollutants). Findings: The empirical findings stress that supply chains should favour in the future railway (or intermodal) connections for piggyback and containerised cargo. Herein lays the reason for the examination of all traditional factors affecting the modal choice and their complementation by the parameters to measure sustainability throughout the supply chains. The inclusion of the green practices positively affected the environmental, social and economic performance of the new approach. Research limitations/implications: This research focuses on the delivery of cargo in containers and semi-trailers within wagons through the overland corridors. Despite the restrictive empirical findings within the national transport system, some elements can be representative of the international supply chains, provided that intermodal services are the most appropriate for the transportation over long distances. Practical implications: Clients, media and regulatory bodies stress the consideration of environmental aspects at all stages of a global supply chain. Therefore, their adoption into strategic imperatives of local supply chains becomes inevitable. Originality/value: An assessment of supply chains for longer distance transportation in Russia has not taken sustainability into account within cost analyses. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to empirically evaluate the key impediments to the competitiveness of the rail sector in Australia; and second, to provide relevant transport management and policy recommendations for enhanced competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach: This paper has adopted an empirical approach. A survey was developed and distributed among rail stakeholders in Australia. Accordingly, exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were conducted to evaluate the key impeding areas. Findings: This paper found four areas that are impeding rail development, these being infrastructure management, shortage of freight data and poor information sharing, service delivery and organisational and commercial interactions. Research limitations/implications: The theoretical approach of this thesis can be applied to any freight market where competition exists between different transport modes. However, the specific strategies provided in this research in terms of transportation management, infrastructure planning and policy were made according to the specific market condition, infrastructure quality and regulation that exist in Australia. Practical implications: The findings provide important implications for both industry and government in terms of making transport planning and policy decisions, but also useful insights by identifying the weak parts of the rail sector and directions to target them. Originality/value: The notion of the rail stakeholder does not appear to have been previously defined in the literature. Therefore, this research takes a broader view of rail stakeholders to include various interest groups within the rail sector and its operational environment. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Economic and social factors, including existing trends in urban population and employment growth combined with urbanization, have led to enhanced consumption and thus, increasing freight flows in the cities. Mitigation of transport impacts has led to plans towards a more sustainable urban environment. However, managerial and regulatory barriers restrict the incorporation of technological instruments and solutions to the sustainable dimension of decision-making and planning. This paper has sought to bridge this gap by organizing an educational and training program, which involves the participation of todays and tomorrow’s researchers, decision-makers and practitioners. Towards this direction, a methodology is developed that identifies existing gaps between the transport industry and the existing research, education and training programs and converts identified requirements and gaps into training courses. The paper addresses the context of intermodal interconnections for the case of Latvia and the region for stimulating and strengthening its scientific and technological capacity by providing knowledge in the field of smart interconnecting sustainable transport networks. The 2-level gap analysis that was developed and implemented with respect to the thematic areas of (1) ‘Governance and policy development’, (2) ‘Smart solutions’, and (3) ‘Decision-making’, and the validation process that followed, has revealed several requirements that exist currently for passenger and freight interchanges and educational programs for Latvia and the region. Based on the identified educational requirements for Latvia and the region, 20 educational areas were created that resulted in 12 courses for passenger and freight transport interchanges that are going to be used for training and education in Latvia. © 2017 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.},

abstract={Flexibility is a major concern in engineering design. This paper examines two complementary approaches to designing flexibility into engineering systems. One approach, based on system decomposition, emphasizes a one-to-one mapping between form and function, as in modular designs. The second approach decouples form from function, enabling a many-to-many mapping, as in layered designs. These approaches need not be mutually exclusive; rather, they can be synergistic. These claims are examined using simulated intermodal freight shipping networks. Results show that systems relying on decomposition are especially sensitive to disruptions. In contrast, systems relying on abstraction are less sensitive to disruption as long as rates of change in the environment are low; however, they are also less able to respond to unmet demand. Given enough resources, systems using both approaches can respond both to disruptions and unmet demand. Implications for system design are discussed. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Combining efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability is crucial for companies to succeed in today’s context of fierce competition. This paper investigates how intermodal transport can be adopted for managing supply chains according to a Lean and Green approach. A scenario-based estimation tool was developed to quantify the potential demand for intermodal transport. The tool was applied to the Italian Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) supply chain. Following, a single longitudinal case study on an FMCG company (Procter & Gamble) was carried out to investigate the enabling factors for the adoption of intermodal transport. Our results show that it is possible to shift demand from road to rail: a number of pathways for action were identified that related to planning and management, assets, train services, collaboration, legal issues and incentive schemes. Also, a collaborative business model for making the modal shift possible was presented. This paper is original because it offers an investigation of Lean and Green Supply Chain Management through intermodal transport by adopting a supply chain perspective and providing a bridging link between academic studies and field evidence. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={There is a growing demand for freight transportation in recent times due to trade globalisation and increase in technological innovations. Intermodal freight transportation system is perceived to be a sustainable means of bridging the gap between producers and consumers in the worldwide supply and demand chain. Research into maritime-hinterland transportation has been the focus of most researchers currently. The optimisation of intermodal freight transportation network system is therefore very crucial for maritime-hinterland transportation solutions. This paper provides an integrated optimisation model which take into account cost, transit time and carbon emissions and the trade-offs among these factors to ensure sustainable intermodal network systems. A numerical experiment was performed using data from a developing country, Ghana as the focus of this study. The results offer a real insight into how trade-offs among cost, time and carbon emissions could benefit all the stakeholders within the intermodal network system.},

abstract={This paper specifies a cloud-based cooperative decision support system (DSS) that aims at integrating logistics management and decision support strategies for intermodal transportation systems. The proposed DSS is dedicated to synchronize different transportation means by using the modern information and communications technology tools and by taking into account environmental aspects. This paper describes the DSS cloud-based architecture and presents the procedure to be followed in order to design a DSS able to support decision makers in different logistic decision fields. The advantages of the proposed DSS are enlightened by specifying three main decision modules: Cargo transport optimization, intelligent truck parking, and CO2 monitoring. Moreover, the applicability of the proposed DSS is described by specifying a DSS for the case study of the logistic network of the Trieste port (Italy), including the port, the inland terminal, and the highway connecting them. Some simulation campaigns are employed both to set the decision modules and evaluate the DSS application benefits. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent years the role of sustainable and alternative transportation concepts has significantly grown in importance due to increasing freight transport volumes, congested roads and intensifying environmental problems. Various industries understand intermodal transportation as a solution and feasible alternative to unimodal road transportation, as it combines the strengths of different transportation modes. Long-haul transportation that usually is carried out by rail or waterborne transportation represents a key feature of intermodal transport chains distinguishing them from unimodal transport chains. However, so far there has been no systematic analysis of the effect of long-haul transportation on the performance of an intermodal transport chain in terms of transportation time and transport time reliability. The aim of this paper is therefore to analyze and evaluate the effect of long-haul transportation on performance by proposing an analytical and a simulation model. The analysis contributes to a better understanding of impacts resulting from different modal shares as well as influencing variables and enables to derive recommendations for future transport planning.},

abstract={The transportation of goods is essential for the economy, but it also contributes to air pollution which, in turn, affects human health. These negative impacts generate additional costs for society that are not necessarily taken into account in public transportation policies and in private transportation decisions of companies and individuals. This leads to inefficient transportation systems where the social equilibrium is not reached. Intermodal transport is promoted by the European Commission to reduce these negative externalities. The objective of this paper is to analyze at a strategic level the effect on modal split between road, intermodal rail and intermodal inland waterway transport of several economic or environmental policies. An intermodal allocation model is applied to the Belgian case in order to identify the modal split changes between the single minimization of costs (operational or health-related external) and the introduction of additional road taxes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={To cope with an intense and competitive environment, intermodal freight transport operators have increasingly adopted business practices —like horizontal and vertical business integration—which aim to reduce the operational costs, increase the profit margins, and improve their competitive position in the market. These strategies and business practices could potentially affect the competition level in the IFT market by increasing the market concentration. The impact can be on the separate submarkets (e.g., transshipment market or main-haulage market) or the whole market for IFT services at the network level. To investigate the impact of these business practices on the market structure of IFT networks, we present a model to analyze the market structure of IFT submarkets and extend the results to the network level. Using this multi-level market analysis model, we can evaluate the decisions made by firms and the market outcomes that result. The application of the presented model is also illustrated using a numerical example. The numerical example shows, for instance, that the impact of a merger, as a business practice, on the competition level in an IFT market —and its submarkets— depends on the merger type (horizontal and vertical). Furthermore, different indicators that “represent” market structure and competition, might react differently to a merger in an IFT network. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this paper, a two-level sustainable mobility strategy for future cities is suggested and the potential key role of transit-oriented development (TOD) is discussed with reference to both the internal and external movements of people. In particular, a people-oriented and place-based approach is advocated. Governments should endeavour to move beyond simply pledging to reduce carbon emission to a specific level by a certain year but to adopt a life cycle approach in guiding the planning and development of future cities. There may need to be a shift in the system with a different balance of transport modes. Moreover, the correct type and mix of transport modes need to be provided with respect to where people and their activities are. Moreover, it is necessary to explicitly recognize the value of travel for both economic and non-economic purposes. Building upon the existing literature, this paper proposes three new directions for planning TODs in future cities. Firstly, the built environment should be understood at both the neighbourhood and city scales. Secondly, the success of TODs needs to be judged not just by the public transit patronage but also by the share of walking and other urban planning and design features like greenery and vibrancy. Thirdly, it is neither possible nor desirable to have uniformly high density, diversity and same design in every TOD neighbourhood. Using Hong Kong as an example, five major types of TOD neighbourhoods are identified. For intercity movements, integrated transport with seamless intermodal transfers and station–neighbourhood integration should be developed in future cities. More research should be done on quantifying and fostering the co-benefits associated with TOD. © 2016 The Institute of Urban Sciences.},

abstract={European legislation implies the use of marginal social cost pricing in rail access charges levied on rail operators. Thus, they may include specific environmental charges to internalise the impacts of rail transport. However, when applying these principles in practice, several difficulties call for second-best settings adapted to the particularities of the rail market. In this context, few European railway administrations are already implementing rail access charges with an environmental dimension. This paper reviews the literature on the issue and assesses the current European experience in noise and air pollution rail charges. For this purpose, an analytical framework is built on the definition of four basic dimensions: charging approach, allocation of abatement efforts, degree of differentiation and intermodal approach. The qualitative examination of the existing systems suggests that the level of environmental surcharges can be generally increased given the low substitutability between rail and road and that the range of abatement possibilities should be enlarged by further differentiating charges. It is also found that the pricing scope should be adapted to achieve particular cost-efficient allocations of abatement efforts among rail operators and upstream agents. Finally, further research requirements for a quantitative assessment are defined. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Intermodal road-rail transport (IRRT) has a significant urban dimension, which affects the modal shift potential and the environmental benefits of rail freight. This paper explores the relevance of local policies for sustainable modal shift strategies by conceptualising the links between urban planning and rail freight. The presented framework identifies measures that local authorities can apply in order to increase the market and environmental improvement potential of IRRT. The results indicate that local urban transport planning has a significant role to play in the promotion of rail freight. Integrating rail freight into long-term urban development plans offers new possibilities for rail freight that are necessary in order to achieve a sustainable freight transport system in the face of ever-increasing road transport volumes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The European Commission noticed that “all residual barriers between modes” have to be removed to the effect that intermodal road–rail freight transport is considered as an alternative to unimodal road freight transport. Hence, the identification of facilitators and barriers is crucial to increase the intermodal road–rail transport modal split ratio. However, rational arguments to modal shift from road transport to intermodal road–rail transport might be distorted by behavioral biases as bounded rationality influences the decision making. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to identify how biasing effects in regard to prospect theory influence decision makers’ perception of the facilitators and barriers to modal shift from road transport to intermodal road–rail transport. Firstly, we perform a literature review to examine the facilitators and barriers. Secondly, based on the qualitative data derived from 92 interviews with different freight transport executives in Germany, we test our theory-driven propositions and investigate, systemize and validate how behavioral biases, barriers and facilitators influence the willingness of forwarders’ decision makers to modal shift from road transport to intermodal road–rail transport. The results suggest that the main facilitators to enhance the intermodal share are for example working conditions of truck drivers, environmental constraints and high fuel prices, respectively, low fuel prices act as a barrier. The results further indicate that biasing effects like loss aversion or diminishing sensitivity rather leverage than mitigate decision makers’ perception of both facilitators and barriers implying a decreased proneness and increased rigidness to modal shift from road transport to intermodal road–rail transport. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

To date, studies show conflicting results for PM2.5 exposures based on mode of commuting, and few studies compare multiple modes of transportation simultaneously along a common route, making inter-modal comparisons difficult. In this study, we examined breathing zone PM2.5 exposures for six different modes of commuting (bicycle, walking, driving with windows open and closed, bus, and light-rail train) simultaneously on a single 2.7 km (1.68 mile) arterial urban route in Salt Lake City, Utah (USA) during peak “rush hour” times. Using previously published minute ventilation rates, we estimated the inhaled dose and exposure rate for each mode of commuting. Mean PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 5.20 μg/m3 for driving with windows closed to 15.21 μg/m3 for driving with windows open. The estimated inhaled doses over the 2.7 km route were 6.83 μg for walking, 2.78 μg for cycling, 1.28 μg for light-rail train, 1.24 μg for driving with windows open, 1.23 μg for bus, and 0.32 μg for driving with windows closed. Similarly, the exposure rates were highest for cycling (18.0 μg/hr) and walking (16.8 μg/hr), and lowest for driving with windows closed (3.7 μg/hr). Our findings support previous studies showing that active commuters receive a greater PM2.5 dose and have higher rates of exposure than commuters using automobiles or public transportation. Our findings also support previous studies showing that driving with windows closed is protective against traffic-related PM2.5 exposure. © 2017 Chaney et al.

abstract={Gilbert and Perl (2007) established how different epochs in human history came with specific “transport revolutions.” Our research suggests that intermodal approaches could constitute an invisible transport planning revolution. Based on a review defining “social” sustainability as it applies to urban passenger transportation, we consider the potential of an intermodal focus to better integrate non-motorized (walking-cycling) and public transportation. We start from the premise that rather than being a primary “mono-mode” such as buses or trains, sustainable transport is best understood as an ecology of modes with specific strengths and complementarities that can be mobilized through planning. Using data from Metropolitan Santiago (Chile), we explore this potential, from a conceptual, mainly social, and spatial perspective. We find that paying more attention to different formats of cycling, public transport integration could significantly improve low-cost alternatives for individual and feeder trips. Moreover, adjusting land use to non-work trip purposes could yield substantial benefits. This approach also offers the possibility of developing relatively simple tools helpful for improving the deliberative aspects of participatory planning, thereby increasing buy-in as well as improving health, efficiency, safety, and other benefits of sustainable transport. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Intermodal Transport (IT) allows savings in energy, time and costs, improves the quality of services and supports sustainable development of the transport system. In order to make IT more competitive it is necessary to support the development of intermodal transport terminal (ITT), whereby it is very important to make adequate decision on its location. This paper proposes a framework for the selection of the ITT location which would be most appropriate for the various stakeholders (investors, users, administration and residents). They often have conflicting goals and interests, so it is necessary to define a large number of criteria for the evaluation. A novel hybrid MCDM model that combines fuzzy Delphi, fuzzy Delphi based fuzzy ANP (fuzzy DANP) and fuzzy Delphi based fuzzy Višekriterijumska Optimizacija i kompromisno Rešenje (fuzzy DVIKOR) methods is developed in this paper with the aim of providing support to decision makers. The model is developed in the fuzzy environment in order to overcome the ambiguity and uncertainty of the decision makers' evaluations of the criteria, sub-criteria and alternatives. The validity and applicability of the model is demonstrated by successfully resolving the problem of selecting the location of the ITT in the City of Belgrade. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Recent trends in port performance improvement include the coordination of intermodal transport logistics to reduce congestion and inefficiencies generated at the gates of the terminals. Congestion at the gate of a terminal generates several problems such as pollution and long waiting times for truck carriers. As part of the strategies and best practices to reduce congestion, some ports worldwide have implemented advanced booking systems in order to coordinate truck arrivals and deliveries at the gate of their container terminals. We will refer to these systems as truck appointment systems. In general terms, a truck appointment system provides a mechanism where truck carriers coordinate their time of arrival at the container terminal based on an advanced booking. In this way, gate managers are able to better plan their port operations and equipment allocation, to reduce the waiting times of trucks and improve the turnaround time for container deliveries. In order to account for the real benefits of such systems, the particular conditions of each container terminal need to be considered. In this paper, a case study of a Chilean port terminal is analyzed. The aim is to provide recommendations that may reduce congestion and improve the container terminal´s gate control of truck arrivals, turnaround times and container deliveries by means of efficient lane segmentation policies. Several scenarios were examined under which different booking levels are considered for an environment in which the arrival of containers can vary significantly from day to day and on a seasonal basis. As a basis for our study a fractional factorial design is performed in order to analyze the impact of controllable factors on two service levels measures, which reduce the number of scenarios needed to obtain robust conclusions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The article presents the problem of containers storage on a storage yard in an rail-road intermodal land and the emission of harmful exhaust gases into the atmosphere. This issue was considered from the point of view of the distance traveled by transshipment devices, the duration of loading work and the resulting energy expenditure and CO2 emissions. The research was dictated by the current limited number of publications in the area of the distribution of containers on storage yards in rail-road intermodal terminals. The vast majority of the literature is devoted in this field to marine intermodal terminals, which operating characteristics are different from inland terminals. The importance of this problem resulting from the growing turnover of containers transported by rail transport was also pointed out. The systematic increase of this type of transport and the depletion of the intermodal services' operating capability makes it necessary to improve the processes taking place in the storage area. The possibility of improving these processes in addition to the use of computer tools is also realized through the use of modern transshipment devices. Depending on the area of their operation and the scope of their application, these devices use various types of power supply, which affect environmental pollution. In the case of gantry cranes considered in this article, their power supply may come from both combustion engines, hybrids and electric engines. Therefore, from the point of view of minimization of harmful exhaust gases emissions into the atmosphere, in the article, the problem of choosing the device for carrying out transshipment tasks was also taken up. For the purposes of the research, the processes of container handling in the rail-road intermodal terminal have been presented in detail. A review of literature in the field of container storage methods and strategies was carried out. The considered container reloading processes in the wagon-yard relation were modeled in the FlexSim simulation environment. The constructed simulation model was used to develop 5 variants of the distribution of containers on the storage yard as a function of their location on the train. Container deployments on the storage yard were carried out for both random and fixed distribution of containers on the train. In the case of a random arrangement of containers on the train, the tests were carried out for 100 replications. On the basis of simulation tests, the distance covered by the transshipment device (RTG crane) and the time of carrying out the loading tasks in particular variants were determined. Using the crane data provided by the crane manufacturer, the energy expenditure was calculated in individual variants for different power supply methods (combustion engine, hybrid, electric engine). The obtained results allowed the selection of the best strategy for containers storage, taking into account the amount of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere by transshipment devices. © 2018, Middle Pomeranian Scientific Society of The Environment Protection.

abstract={The transport policy of the European Union is based on the mission of restructuring road traffic into other and energy-favourable transport modes which have not been sufficiently represented yet. Therefore, the development of the inland waterway and rail transport, and connectivity in the intermodal transport network are development planning priorities of the European transport strategy. The aim of this research study was to apply the scientific methodology and thus analyse the factors that affect the distribution of the goods flows and by using the fuzzy logic to make an optimization model, according to the criteria of minimizing the costs and negative impact on the environment, for the selection of the optimal transport route. Testing of the model by simulation, was performed on the basis of evaluating the criteria of the influential parameters with unprecise and indefinite input parameters. The testing results show that by the distribution of the goods flow from road transport network to inland waterways or rail transport, can be predicted in advance and determine the transport route with optimal characteristics. The results of the performed research study will be used to improve the process of planning the transport service, with the aim of reducing the transport costs and environmental pollution. © 2018, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering.

abstract={La Manga del Mar Menor is a spit between the Mediterranean Sea and the Minor Sea. The dimensions of this sandbar are about 20 km length and about 100 m of average wide, with only one access at South by landside. Due to its natural attractive, beaches, weather, gastronomy and diversity of leisure options, La Manga is the main seaside tourist town in the Region of Murcia (Spain). It is an attractive area, mainly in July and August, when traffic problems increase significantly. Note that, because of its dimensions there is only one access route and one exit route. This physical limitation makes congestion worse because there is not enough space to alternative routes. Moreover, all external effects related to traffic, such as noise and pollution, also increase. These effects damage the initial quality of life of this area and cast serious doubts on his sustainability. A Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) has been developed at La Manga in order to encourage sustainable mobility through a rational use of the private car and to ensure and make easier the intermodality among public transport, bicycles and pedestrian areas. Two packages of measures have been developed. Specifically, infrastructural measures focus on improving sustainable mobility. For example, a dissuasive car park near to intermodal area to connect all transport mode easily, measures to improve fluidity of local buses or safe cycle-lines. All these measures are evaluated economically. The other package of measures is focused on economic measures, such as intermodal transport card or environmental taxes. These measures are described qualitatively. Currently, the local government is studying all proposals in order to agree on clear responsibilities and, allocate budgets to put them into practice, to transform La Manga in a place with quality of life throughout years. © 2018 WIT Press.},

abstract={This article addresses the problem of container storage in a container terminal. Container terminals constitute essential intermodal interfaces for the global transport network. The optimal location for a container in a terminal is very important to port operators as it directly impacts the overall performance of the container terminal and helps maximise throughput due to the higher efficiency it provides. In our work, we propose an approach to solving the container storage problem by describing a decision model that simulates, solves and optimises available storage space to handle the departures and arrivals of full containers in a seaport. In other words, this is a model that minimises the total number of unnecessary movements while respecting the space and time dynamics of the environment. The interest of this work concerns the development of a software tool that identifies the best location for a container using the ant colony algorithm that is integrated into a decisional model. The latter is being proposed to the port operator for a possible choice. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={When attempting to reduce atmospheric emissions, a strategy commonly suggested by experts is the replacement of road transport with rail transport. However, in many countries and for many companies worldwide a complete transition to rail transport of freight is not feasible due to either a lack of available railway infrastructure or high investment costs. With that in mind, this paper aims to assess the potential of road-rail intermodal operations as a strategy to reduce atmospheric emissions, and thereby help mitigate climate change worldwide. This was achieved by quantifying and comparing emissions of CO2, CO, CH4, NOx, hydrocarbons and particulate matter in a case-study that considered road-only and intermodal road-rail routes from 17 production facilities to their nearest port, according to International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) policies, as well as Euro V and EPA (United State Environmental Protection Agency) emission standards. The results showed that an intermodal road-rail operations would reduce emissions by up to 77.4%, be up to 43.48% more fuel-efficient and up to 80% cheaper than operating solely with road transport, posing as a viable strategy to enable more companies and countries to mitigate climate change. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This model optimizes port hinterland intermodal refrigerated container flows, considering both cost and quality degradation, which is distinctive from the previous literature content in a way that it quantifies the influence of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission in different setting temperature on intermodal network planning. The primary contribution of this paper is that the model is beneficial not only to shippers and customers for the novel service design, but also offer, for policy-makers of the government, insights to develop inland transport infrastructures in consideration of intermodal transportation. The majority of models of multimodal system have been established with an objective of cost minimization for normal commodities. As the food quality is possible to be influenced by varying duration time required for the storage and transportation, and transportation accompanied with refrigeration producing more CO2 emission, this paper aims to address cost minimization and quality degradation minimization within the constraint of CO2 footprint. To achieve this aim, we put the quality degradation model in a mixed-integer linear programming model used for intermodal network planning for cold chain. The example of Dalian Port and Yingkou Port offer insight into trade-offs between transportation temperature and transport mode considering CO2 footprint. Furthermore, the model can offer a useful reference for other regions with the demand for different imported food, which requires an uninterrupted cold chain during the transportation and storage. © 2018 De Gruyter Open Ltd.

abstract={Despite a growing literature on strategies to reduce emissions and other externalities in shipping and ports, very little attention has been given to the port's role in reducing negative externalities in its hinterland. This paper addresses this gap by reviewing ports across the globe to identify which ports have implemented measures to improve the environmental performance of hinterland transport. Results show that only 76 out of 365 ports examined are doing so. The measures applied are identified, related to different goals and their challenges discussed. The most common measures are found to be technology improvements, infrastructure development and monitoring programmes, and the most advanced ports in green hinterland strategies are Rotterdam, Los Angeles/Long Beach and Hamburg, although many ports that are world leaders in green port strategies have not implemented measures in the hinterland dimension. Different port groups are segmented according to their mix of goals and measures as a foundation for future research. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The recent European regulations on emissions from heavy duty vehicles (Euro VI) along with the enforcement of ECA regulations have represented an additional challenge for the sustainability of the motorways of the sea. The main aim of this paper is to identify the optimal sizing and the most adequate propulsion plant for a fleet of feeder vessels that, by operating under motorways of the sea conditions, is able to articulate competitive intermodal chains versus the road for the door-to-door transport by ensuring the sustainability of the intermodality in the current normative framework. Thus, a mathematical model is developed to evaluate, aside from the total costs and the time invested in the transport, the environmental costs of the unimodal transport and of intermodal chains with different sizing and technologies for the vessels. The resolution of this multiobjective model was carried out with an NSGA-II algorithm in an application to a transport network between Spain and France. This application concluded that fast and small vessels with LNG propulsion plants are the most convenient to maximize the competitiveness advantage against the road alternative. Likewise, the analysis of the environmental performance of both transport systems in the application case from 2010 to 2015 shows an unfavourable environmental evolution for the intermodality. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Ports are an important player in the world, due to their role in global production and distributions systems. They are major intermodal transport hubs, linking the sea to the land. For all ports, a key requirement for commercial and economic viability is to retain ships using them and to remain accessible to those ships. Ports need to find approaches to help them remain open. They must ensure their continued economic viability. At the same time, they face increasing pressure to become more environmentally and socially conscious. This paper examines the approach taken by the Port of Gävle, Sweden, which used contaminated dredged materials to create new land using principles of Circular Economy. The paper demonstrates that using Circular Economy principles can be a viable way of securing a port's future and contributing to its sustainability, and that of the city/region where it operates. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In intermodal freight transportation, train load planners are confronted with complex practical considerations during the booking and planning process. In order to optimally utilize the available loading space, train capacity is monitored in terms of available length and weight while accounting for the urgency with which load units must be sent. Furthermore, the execution of the load plan by the terminal operator must be performed efficiently to minimize total handling costs. In this paper, a static model with multiple objectives is developed to introduce a number of practical constraints from the viewpoint of the network operator. Numerical experiments are performed using an exact ε-constraint method as well as a multi-directional local search heuristic. It is shown that the multi-objective approach provides train load planners with a set of train load plans, for which the trade-offs between the different objectives can be analyzed. Given this information, the most suitable plan can be determined based on the real-time operational environment. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Introduction: The importance of the transport infrastructure role is often described in the attempt to describe the characteristics of a “smart city”. Good planning and organization of communication networks contributes to the development of cities that are more fluid and user-friendly and sustainable, concepts underlying “smart cities”. The paper focuses on the impact on social organisation and on conception of transport intermodal infrastructures such as city-hubs inducing new and smarter practices of transport infrastructure, but also the urban dimension and their insertion through the actual city and, even more, by the creation of an entirely new neighbourhood and the preoccupation of a better quality of life. As part of the European research project FP7 “City-HUB”, 27 interchanges have been studied in nine European countries. The paper emphases on the implementation of the City-HUB interchange typology to the case study of Lille European Metropolis (MEL) where two contingent railway stations, Lille Flandres and Lille Europe, were analysed as a potential unique interchange named “Euraflandres”with socio-economic impacts and the possibility that it may become a “place” of life in the smart city. Methods: Within the FP7 project City-HUB a literature review was conducted on the role and characteristics of interchanges in the cities and their contribution to smart cities [29]. For 27 interchanges in nine European countries, we have determined a number of relationships between these transport multimodal interchanges and their environment, and established a typology capturing different interchanges and a scheme for scoring their characteristics in terms of function and logistic dimensions (demand, number of transport modes, services and facilities, location in the city) and their local constraints. The governance framework was specified through carrying out semi-structured interviews with key interchange actors for each City-HUB case study that also questioned about the role of interchanges in local economies and their potential impact on that. The Lille Flandres and Lille Europe as a unique landmark “Euraflandres” were particularly studied to understand their characteristics and role to contribute to a smarter city. Results: Based on the City-HUB typology, the “Euraflandres” gets a score of 9 because its demand is higher than 120,000 in daily passengers, includes 13 public and private transport modes (several PT, long distance coaches, car and bike), is located in the city centre and is included into a local plan of urban development and TOD definition. “Euraflandres” has all the characteristics for becoming an urban Landmark for the city of Lille. We show how this interchange gets a higher role for being a node on the international railway network, and how their inside and outside spatial and functioning reorganisation contribute to ease the use of public transport for travellers by introducing ITS, innovations in ticketing and providing new urban characteristics transforming transport infrastructures into new places to live. Conclusions: Linking the smart city and the development made with “Euraflandres”, we have seen that an opportunity exists to join together the two Lille railway stations and urban Public Transport interchanges in order to combine a great urban interchange. It will procure advantages for increasing the accessibility for all destinations at urban Lille metropolis and regional level, but also at the national and international levels by the possibility offered by the French TGVs running on national network and the Railteam high speed trains such as Eurostar and Thalys. Each type of interchange, according to the identified functions and local constraints, should require the involvement of different stakeholders interchanges and the Lille City-HUB management with its stakeholders’ committees seems to be oriented to make effort for finding an agreed way for reducing conflicts, in order to better plan outcomes and to allow communities to have an influence over the future shape of the places where they live. The community-led participation is the first step to identify requirements and needs of operators (i.e. transport activities including services and facilities) and of users who will perceive the City-HUB as a transport node and a place where to have access to their mobility mode and where to carry out some other activities during their waiting time. Despite existing barriers (complex governance framework, physical barriers, functions and logistics to revise, local constraints), all the stakeholders are willing to improve the visibility and the functionality of these interchanges. “Euraflandres” has the role of developing activities and regenerating the urban environment, by transforming the surrounding area features. All this will make cities more convivial and fluid, answering to two key aspects of the Smart City, when we follow the definition of the smart city as a “fluid”, “intelligent” and “convivial” city by [4]. The extension of the Euralille neighbourhood where is located “Euraflandres”, is part of the Lille urban regeneration, still under construction, will provide new housing and also social housing for low income people and new city amenities transforming it in a new place to live transforming the current two separated interchange towards the future one landmark interchange with a higher share of sustainable and affordable public transport modes share. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={The sustainability of container transferia, a specific type of intermodal terminals located in the vicinity of ports, is analysed in an external cost evaluation. This concept enables transporting large amounts of containers from a port to a transferium, outside the most congested area, by high-frequency barge or rail transport. From this point onwards, the transport is executed by truck or intermodal. The paper presents a case study of maritime-based container transport in Belgium. A geographic information systems-based model compares transport alternatives, regarding their societal impact. The findings suggest that when trucks perform the hinterland transport to transferia instead of direct truck transport to the port, the production of external costs decreases in the port area, but remains stable in the hinterland. However, when intermodal chains can replace these truck services to the transferia, external costs remain limited in the port area, but also decrease in the hinterland in most cases. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The basic idea behind the concept of a dry port is a more efficient seaport access, movement of the seaport’s interface inland with the shift of flows from road to rail. The application of the concept results in a reduction of road transport to/from the seaport together with the associated broad social and environmental benefits. This paper examines the complex factors influencing the timeframes and location of close inland intermodal terminals with dry port characteristics - metropolitan intermodal terminals, as they are usually referred to - and their implementation, with a case study of the Sydney metropolitan region and Port Botany, Australia. The issues surrounding suburban freight terminals are a sub-set of the wider social and environmental problems of the interactions of seaports with their hinterland. Port Botany and its close inland intermodal terminals are very distinctive: there are very few ports in the world with such a well-developed network of close inland intermodal terminals. Nevertheless, the Moorebank terminal was first mooted in 2003 but the latest plans anticipate operations commencing in 2018. The paper illustrates some problematic aspects of long timeframes for the development of significant freight infrastructure. © 2018, Faculty of Maritime Studies. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Underground freight transportation (UFT) is a class of automated transportation systems in which vehicles carry freight through tunnels or pipelines under roadways between intermodal terminals. The UFT systems increase the current freight movement capacity and alleviate the problems associated with the fast growing need for freight transportation. Despite the inherent UFT benefits to alleviate traffic congestion and enhance safety and security of freight transportation while improving sustainability, a detailed lifecycle benefit-cost analysis is yet required to explicitly show planners and decision makers the economic feasibility of such systems. The primary objective of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive lifecycle benefit-cost analysis of linear induction motor-based UFT systems for five different scenarios. This methodology includes the following steps: (1) developing UFT scenarios with different sizes (small, medium, and large) and routes (short and long) in collaboration with a stakeholder committee; (2) determining lifecycle cash flows; (3) calculating net present values, benefit-cost ratios, and internal rates of returns; (4) conducting sensitivity analysis; and (5) performing breakeven analysis. The results of this research show that the highest benefits of the UFT systems are revenue from shipment and reduction in air pollution. The internal rates of return, benefit-cost ratios, and net present values of the UFT scenarios indicate that the benefits offset the costs of the system. Results of sensitivity analysis show that the economic feasibility of the large and medium-size UFTs is more sensitive to tunnel construction cost and revenue from shipments. They also indicate that the economic feasibility of the UFT system with a short route and small size is more sensitive to higher discount rates and the policies concerning the shipment pricing. Results of breakeven analysis highlight a shorter payback period for the large and medium-size UFTs compared with small-size scenarios. The results show that the price of shipment for all the UFT scenarios is highly competitive compared with the current price of shipment by trucks. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={The planning of vessel navigation along a tidal river is a complex task that can affect the efficiency of inland ports and intermodal chains. The availability of water may represent a significant restriction to port accessibility, having an impact on waiting times, cost and even safety. This paper presents a heuristic procedure to schedule vessels on a tidal waterway, which seeks to optimise navigation according to a multi-criteria objective function combining the number of vessels serviced, the total waiting time, the waterway occupation time and the number of crossing operations, where the term crossing implies inbound and outbound vessels passing each other. The procedure requires a previous step of estimation of real-time water depth, which identifies the critical points or navigation bottlenecks along the waterway, and contemplates the possibility of vessels having to anchor in the middle of their journey and wait for next tide rise. We validate the procedure through its application to a set of real and test problems and show that its results are reliable in terms of performance and solution quality. © 2017 The Royal Institute of Navigation.},

abstract={Identification of optimum routes and mode of transport play vital roles in freight transport decision making. This paper presents the research carried out for the modelling and analysis of intermodal transport network. The study evaluates the trade-offs associated with different modes of freight transportation. Geographic Information System (GIS) and MATLAB were applied to design the hypothetical intermodal freight transportation network, modelling, analysis and user-interface design. An optimum route and transport mode for different pairs of origins and destinations were determined across decision objectives such as distance, time, emission and cost. The trade-offs among different modes of freight transportation were explored. Based on the assumptions of this study, the results showed that the road was the fastest mode, while waterway was not only the most cost-efficient but also was the most environmental-friendly transport mode in terms of carbon dioxide emission. Although the transport network of the study was small size and hypothetical, this paper demonstrates the potentiality of this methodology for analysing larger and real intermodal networks. © School of Engineering, Taylor's University.},

abstract={Greater use of multimodal transportation can substantially improve the environmental performance of freight transportation. Despite strenuous efforts by public policy-makers to alter the freight modal split, most companies still rely heavily on road transportation, and modal shifts to rail and water have remained modest at best. In this paper we argue that this is partly the result of a failure to take a holistic supply chain view of the modal shift process. Synchromodality provides a framework within which shippers can manage their supply chains more flexibly to increase the potential for shifting mode. On the basis of a literature review, we broaden the conventional focus of multimodal transportation to give it a supply chain dimension, and propose the concept of ‘Synchromodality from a Supply Chain Perspective’ (SSCP). Using a case study we show that when the supply chain impacts are taken into account, it is possible to significantly increase the share of intermodal rail transportation within a corridor, without necessarily increasing total logistics cost or reducing the service level. In this way the environmental impact of freight activities can be significantly reduced. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={To achieve transport cost reductions and to reduce the environmental impact of road transport, different European countries are allowing or testing longer and heavier vehicles on their road network. In Belgium, the Flanders region started a trial in 2015 allowing a limited number of longer and heavier vehicles on a selection of approved routes. A concern among intermodal operators is however that an allowance of longer and heavier vehicles could trigger a reverse modal shift away from rail and inland waterways container transport. Starting from experiences in other European countries, this paper discusses the potential spatial impact of allowing longer and heavier vehicles on the market areas of intermodal transhipment terminals using a geographic information systems-based location analysis model. In a second step, external transport costs are incorporated in this model, to quantify the spatially diversified societal costs of a potential reverse modal shift. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The long term impact posed by climate change risk remains unclear and is subject to diverse interpretations from different maritime stakeholders. The inter-dynamics between climate change and ports can also significantly diversify in different geographical regions. Consequently, risk and cost data used to support climate adaptation is of high uncertainty and in many occasions, real data is often unavailable and incomplete. This paper presents a risk and cost evaluation methodology that can be applied to the analysis of port climate change adaptation measures in situations where data uncertainty is high. Risk and cost criteria are used in a decision-making model for the selection of climate adaptation measures. Information produced using a fuzzy-Bayesian risk analysis approach is utilized to evaluate risk reduction outcomes from the use of adaptation measures in ports. An evidential reasoning approach is then employed to synthesize the risk reduction data as inputs to the decision-making model. The results can assist policymakers in developing efficient adaptation measures that take into account the reduction in the likelihood of risks, their possible consequences, their timeframe, and costs incurred. A technical study across 14 major container ports in Greater China is presented to demonstrate the interaction between cost and risk analysis, and to highlight the applicability of the stated methodology in practice. The paper offers a useful analytical tool for assessing climate change risks to ports and selecting the most cost-effective adaptation measures in uncertain conditions. It can also be used to compare the practitioners’ perceptions of climate risks across different geographical regions, and to evaluate improvements after implementation of the selected adaptation measures with potential budgetary constraints. The methodology, together with the illustrative cases, provides important insights on how to develop efficient climate change adaptation measures in a supply chain context to improve the sustainability of development and enhance adaptation measures for ports, port cities, intermodal transport, supply chains, and urban and regional planning in general. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper provides exact analysis of a model for sustainable control of a one-warehouse-N-retailer inventory system with time based shipment consolidation. The model is motivated by discussions with industry, and involves the possibility to reserve intermodal transportation capacity in combination with truck transports available on demand. Inventories are reviewed continuously while shipments from the warehouse are consolidated for groups of retailers and dispatched periodically. A key result is the derivation of the probability mass functions for the number of units on each shipment. This allows for realistic volume dependent freight cost structures and transportation emissions to be included in the model. We show how to jointly optimize the reorder levels, shipment intervals and capacity reservation quantities to minimize the total expected costs. Transportation emissions are taken into consideration by use of a side constraint or by introducing emissions costs. A numerical example illustrates how the model can be used for evaluating the cost impact of reducing transportation emissions. The analysis is applicable to both single- and multi-item systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Intermodal travel behavior is becoming increasingly important, particularly in large cities. Using and combining different transport modes flexibly on a single trip is discussed as being crucial to a more efficient and sustainable urban transport system. However, research on intermodality has mainly addressed long-distance traffic or specific combinations. This study analyzes how intermodality is practiced in everyday mobility by looking at relevant mode combinations, trip purposes, spatial differentiation and the requirements of intermodal users. The article presents results on intermodal travel behavior from a survey conducted in different neighborhoods in Berlin in 2016 (n = 1098). The results show that many people use intermodal combinations in their everyday mobility. Intermodal travel behavior is significantly characterized by public transport modes and trips to work. Spatial differences in intermodal use become obvious with combinations of bike and public transport being strong in urban neighborhoods, car and public transport in decentralized neighborhoods and combinations of different means of public transport in well-connected neighborhoods. In addition, the study emphasizes that time efficiency is an important aspect for intermodal users, becoming apparent in the reasons they state for performing intermodal trips and their evaluation of interchanges. Intermodal travel behavior and users’ needs must therefore be taken into account in urban planning if the aim is to make the most of intermodal combinations for an effective urban transport system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Confidence in intermodal transport has not yet been defined. There are many different approaches to the concept of trust. However, the authors have integrated them with the paradigm shift in light of the challenges of sustainability. The objective of this article is to indicate the directions and criteria for that indicate the implementation of the paradigm shift, relative to the idea of sustainable transport. The auxiliary objective is to predict which countries in a given year will have the TRUST status, i.e., implement the paradigm shift, and which ones will not implement it (DISTRESS). The study used taxonometric techniques and built a model using General Discriminant Analysis. On these bases, the utility function was approximated, including the directions of implementation of the paradigm shift, depending on the scale of the environmental load of transport. Over the course of this research, an original and innovative econometric model was constructed, pointing to three variables which have the greatest impact on trust. Thanks to the cognitive value of the model, it is possible to identify individuals who deserve trust (i.e., it will implement the paradigm shift) with 93% probability. In the future, it is worth expanding the research by programing models for each country. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={The Dallas Fort Worth International Airport handles about 600,000 metric tons of cargo annually. These shipments are currently transported by trucks from the airport cargo terminals. An underground freight transportation (UFT) system has the potential to substantially reduce the truck traffic within the DFW Airport area and thus improve safety, efficiency, and air quality. The main reason for designing a UFT system in the DFW Airport is security vulnerability, when trucks drive under or near active runways and taxiways and may have hazardous or explosive cargo. Besides, the proposed UFT system is expected to reduce the number of trucks on airport grounds and the airport access roadways, thus enhancing both the roadway access capacity and safety as well as reducing adverse environmental impacts such as emissions and noise. The objective of this paper is to examine the feasibility of underground short-haul freight pipelines to a large airport such as Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) International Airport. The proposed short-haul UFT system transports standard air freight crates between an airport cargo terminal and a distribution center off the secured airport grounds. The DFW Airport UFT system design includes planning level configurations of the tracks, vehicle, propulsion system, end-point terminals, and loading/unloading mechanisms at those terminals. Operational attributes such as speeds, headways, loading/unloading times, and line capacities are also determined. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Efficiency challenges of the hinterland connectivity, along with growing green concerns necessitate the integration of economic goals and environmental considerations, for port-hinterland logistics problems. This study focused on innovative modeling, for a three-mode port-hinterland intermodal freight distribution system, from the perspective of shippers. A hybrid distribution network topology, combining point to point, hub-and-spoke, and connected hubs was designed as route alternatives for loads from origin to destination. A bi-objective decision framework involving analytical scenarios of emissions limitation, emissions taxation, and an emissions trading scheme, was developed for policy analysis, and then applied to a real-life hinterland logistics network in the Yangtze River Economic Belt in China. The results showed that the implementation of the three emissions policies, all resulted in great changes in flows between intermodal routes and achieved emissions reduction goals. Nevertheless, the conflict between logistics costs and carbon emissions, differs from policy to policy. Some inflection points were identified to offer decision supports on policy insights, for the port-hinterland distribution network. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis on cost and emissions parameters was given. It revealed that the flow changes and trade-off relationship between economic and environmental objectives, were both sensitive to the road transportation mode. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Freight transport planning is nowadays encouraged to align with environmental objectives. Among those, climate change is of particular interest for many countries. In its White Paper on Transport, the European Commission considers intermodal transport as a potential solution for reducing environmental impacts. In order to make good strategic transport decisions, realistic decision support models for freight transport networks must be developed, so that insights can be derived for the different stakeholders of the transportation chain. This research proposes a bi-objective mathematical formulation which takes into account economic and environmental objectives, on a road and intermodal network with three modes of transport (road, intermodal rail, and intermodal inland waterways), and in which economies of scale of intermodal transport can be considered. With this model better fitting reality, an application to the Belgian case study provides practical information on how flows, terminal types and locations vary depending on the chosen policy, on the integration or not of economies of scale, on costs or emissions modifications and on the number of terminals to locate. Results show that the chosen policy influences the terminal type and the intermodal market share. The study also highlights the interest of intermodal transport on short distances, and the risk of flow exchanges inside the intermodal market share, rather than between road and intermodal transport. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Intermodal networks offer much flexibility in transport planning, and have the potential to efficiently consolidate goods, even if these goods have distinct pickup locations and destinations. Typically, there is an abundant amount of feasible routes and consolidation opportunities, which makes it challenging to quickly identify good solutions. We propose a planning algorithm for dynamic pickup- and delivery problems in intermodal networks, where freight is consolidated by means of reloads to reduce both costs and emissions. Based on an enumerative arc-expansion procedure, a large number of intermodal routes is generated for each order, of which we store the k best. We subsequently evaluate consolidation opportunities for the k best routes by applying a decision tree structure, taking into account reload operations, timetables, and synchronization of departure windows. Compared to direct road transport, numerical experiments on various virtual problem instances show an average cost saving of 34 %, and an average reduction in CO2 emissions of 30 %. Furthermore, we test our algorithm on a real-life case of a leading logistics service provider based in the Netherlands, which yields significant benefits as well, both in terms of costs and environmental impact. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={In the past 40 years the intermodal transportation has dramatically increased and this trend will continue much faster in the 21st century. Nowadays, the intermodal transportation presents the backbone of world trade. The efficiency of distribution processes is improved by integrating different modes and services of transport. Shippers, who generate the demand for transportations, carriers who supply the transportation services for the demand and also intermodal network determine the performance of the system. Transportation of dangerous goods also reaches upward trend. However, the dangerous transportations have negative effects on the environment and, if an accident occurs, can cause injuries or death. This threat presents very important reason for focusing on improving the security and efficiency for dangerous transports and avoiding of potential accidents. © 2018, University of Dubronvnik.

abstract={The present paper aims at analysing the concept of "urban interchanges" as a solution towards seamless transportation and sustainable mobility. Based on an extensive review of policies, initiatives and data analysis coming from interviews and meetings with stakeholders, a coherent interchange design typology was formulated that links seamless transport and urban interchanges to spatial and urban planning. Focusing on the impact of user satisfaction as a priority towards user travel choices, a list of indicators was valuated. The comparative analysis of interchange typology performance formulated by the users' perception regarding network accessibility, surrounding area, offered interchange time facilities and environmentally friendly services and infrastructure revealed fruitful findings on proper interchange design towards sustainability and reformation of the city-hubs into true green urban interchanges. © 2018 De Gruyter Open Ltd.

abstract={The current state of the North Port, part of the Port of Split predetermined for the cargo turnover, shows modest rate traffic. The paper examines if there is a potential for the further development and modernization of the port by integrating the Short Sea Shipping (SSS) services. Analysis regarding the main principles of the SSS concept has been provided for the North Port in order to penetrate and exploit new markets and demands as well as the directions of the future growth, mainly by using intermodal transport services. This implies particularly the revitalization of the Una track and investments in “green” technologies with the purpose of lowering the external costs of transport and positioning on the market as a green port offering lower harbour fees and taxes. With the implementation of new technologies based on sustainable development, eco-friendly mechanization, and port equipment, the North Port could establish new markets positioned in the hinterland and gravitational background of the city of Split and achieve a higher cargo turnover, primarily in the container transport, but also in the other segments of the port business. © 2018, University of Dubronvnik.

abstract={This paper explores influences on open access competition in the long-distance passenger rail transport in Europe. It fills a gap in the existing literature by providing expert opinions on open access competition and by identifying and rating factors influencing competition positively or negatively, using a Delphi study. A panel of 30 experts were consulted in three rounds of questionnaires. The combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis reveals the following main findings: open access competition is a tool to revitalise the passenger rail market; however, under the current market conditions, only a limited increase in competition within the next 10 years is expected. The factors showing the highest influence on open access competition are access to attractive train paths, market potential, presence of intermodal competitors, low profitability of the industry, and infrastructure costs. Analysing competition in different EU countries indicates that strength and type of influencing factors are not identical. The results imply that progress concerning market opening has been made; however, much needs to be done to offer a competitive environment and improve conditions for open access competition, e.g. by speeding up the technical harmonisation within the EU or by reconsidering the setting of rail access charges. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to consider the topic of pricing decisions in the context of intermodal transport as a subject of significant influence on intermodality's success and the move towards environment friendly modes to bring about a European sustainable transport system. We review the state of research in intermodal pricing from an Operational Research (OR) perspective as a subject with a vital link to energy consumption and sustainability assessment. In particular, we study freight transport within a revenue-maximizing perspective. Driven by the political incentives to enhance its challenged market position, we direct our discussion to the particular gap in optimization approaches that tackle service prices as explicit tactical decisions from the carriers' point of view. A suggestion to utilize the bilevel programming framework in the present context is put forward, as well as an account of its widely successful application to similar hierarchical decision schemes. Different approaches to express the shippers' behaviour-the potential intermodal transport customers-within the lower level problem are proposed, along with the modelling implications of different possible objectives as well as the multimodal network structures. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={In the fast-moving and competitive market conditions, port operators need to improve their competitiveness to attract more customers. With the rise of stakeholders’ (e.g., shippers and port operators) environmental concerns, intermodal transport offers an opportunity to reduce environmental impacts and improves port competitiveness, due to the benefit on environmental protection. However, it is a challenge to understand how port operators make their plans for intermodal network design with consideration for port competition, shippers’ route choice behaviors and environmental concerns of stakeholders. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretical model of port competition with environmental concerns. A logit model is used to formulate shippers’ discrete choice behaviors. With respect to the probability of nonexistence of pure Nash equilibrium, we propose an approximate equilibrium and a corresponding solution algorithm. A case study on the competition between Dalian port and Yingkou port in the northeast of China is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. Results show that, in competitive settings, the rise of stakeholders’ environmental concerns will make the market less competitive and always be beneficial to the port closer to the market (here Yingkou port). Moreover, when shippers pay more attention to the environment, the total CO2e emissions will decrease. As the number of dry ports increases, the CO2e emissions will decrease. There are also some interesting findings of effects of environmental concerns on the intermodal network, profits, and CO2e emissions. © 2018},

abstract={Intermodal rail/road transportation combines advantages of both modes of transport and is often seen as an effective approach for reducing the environmental impact of freight transportation. This is because it is often expected that rail transportation emits less greenhouse gases than road transportation. However, the actual emissions of both modes of transport depend on various factors like vehicle type, traction type, fuel emission factors, payload utilization, slope profile or traffic conditions. Still, comprehensive experimental results for estimating emission rates from heavy and voluminous goods in large-scale transportation systems are hardly available so far. This study describes an intermodal rail/road network model that covers the majority of European countries. Using this network model, we estimate emission rates with a mesoscopic model within and between the considered countries by conducting a large-scale simulation of road-only transports and intermodal transports. We show that there are high variations of emission rates for both road-only transportation and intermodal rail/road transportation over the different transport relations in Europe. We found that intermodal routing is more eco-friendly than road-only routing for more than 90% of the simulated shipments. Again, this value varies strongly among country pairs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The forecasting of the freight transportation, especially the short-term case, is an important topic in the daily supply chain management. Intermodal freight transportation is subject to multiple complex calendar effects arising in the port environment. The use of prediction methods provides information that may be helpful as a decision-making tool in the management and planning of operations processes in ports. This work addresses the forecasting problem on a daily basis by a novel two-stage scheme combination to offer reliable predictions of fresh freight weight on Ro-Ro (roll-on/roll-off) transport for 7 and 14 days ahead. The study compares daily forecasting with a weekly forecasting approach. The applies database preprocessing and Bayesian regularization neural networks (BRNN) in Stage I. In Stage II, an ensemble framework of the best BRNN models is used to enhance the Stage I forecasting. The results show that the models assessed are a promising tool to predict freight time series for Ro-Ro transport. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={The data collected on second-to-second operations of large-scale freight and logistics systems have increased in recent years. Data analytics can provide valuable insight and improve efficiency and reduce waste of resources. Understanding sources of uncertainty, including emergent and future conditions, is critical to enterprise resilience, recognizing regimes of operations, and to decision-making for capacity expansions, etc. This paper demonstrates analyses of operations data at a marine container terminal and disaggregates layers of uncertainty and discusses implications for operations decision-making and capacity expansion. The layers arise from various sources and perspectives such as level of detail in data collection and compatibilities of data sources, missing entries in databases, natural and human-induced disruptions, and competing stakeholder views of what should be the performance metrics. Among the resulting observations is that long truck turn times are correlated with high traffic volume which is distributed across most states of operations. Furthermore, data quality and presentation of performance metrics should be considered when interpreting results from data analyses. The potential influences of emergent and future conditions of technologies, markets, commerce, environment, behaviors, regulations, organizations, environment, and others on the regimes of terminal operations are examined. © Copyright 2019 by ASME.},

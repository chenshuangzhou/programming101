Trust - most seen in infantile schizophrenia; to regain trust (or to treat schizophrenia), one can reveal an attempt to recover social mutuality by testing a borderlines between senses and physical reality, between words and social meanings. 

Projection (endow significant others with the evil which actually is in us) and introjection (feel and act as if an outer goodness had become an inner certainty). These mechanisms are reinstated in acute crises of love, trust, and faith in adulthood and can characterize irrational attitudes towards adversaries. [E.CS, 223]

Theories of Personality
Definition: The Personality refers to the distinct traits, thoughts, feelings, actions and characteristics of an individual that differentiates him from other individuals. Simply, the personality is the typical behavior of a person in which he responds to the given situations.


 
The term personality is derived from a Latin word ¡±persona¡± which means to speak through, it is also a mask used by actors in Greece and Rome to play different roles or disguise themselves.

Theories of Personality

Since there is no exact definition of the term personality, different theorists from psychology field as well as from other fields dealing with human behavior have carried on researches to find out the answers to certain questions Viz. What is Personality? What does it constitute? How is behavior governed by Personality?

The theories of personality have been grouped as:

personality theories

Psychoanalytic Theory
Socio-Psychological Theory
Trait Theory
Self Theory
Thus, we can say, that personality is the organization of different psychological systems in an individual, who tries to adjust to the external environment.

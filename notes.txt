### 181009 Scale development 
Basic attributes of scales
Conceptualize the target construct
    identify latent construct 
    literature review: 
Develop the initial item pool
    creation of an item pool
Select items to form the scale
Evaluate the psychometric properties of the scale
Data collection
    inclusion of comparison scales
    

### 181002 Causal inference

Validity: external and internal	
Effectiveness of supporting group: 
	Single case study: trend analysis
	RCT: effectiveness evaluation; compliance in RCT can be difficult to achieve
	Pre-experimental study design:
	Selection bias:
Inferring causality
	Cause must precede the effect in time
The two variables are empirically correlated with on another
The observed empirical correlation between the two variables that 
Threats to internal validity
	History, maturation, testing, instrumentation changes, statistical regression, selection bias, ambiguity regarding the direction of causal inference
Conterfactuals
	Find the alternative possibility of unconditional path

Experimental Design
	Randomized group distribution, - randomization still exist
	Contamination: cases within the same cluster may intervene each other 
	Controlling variables: covariates may be influential in the model but assumed not

Hot Et al. (2016)
What do you learn from the flow diagram?
	Describe process and details 
	CONSORT statement: require to report for RCT 

Why is there a need to compare characteristics on the baseline?
	Table 1 baseline characteristics description
	Demonstrate randomization as it should be balanced

What are common challenges in conducting an RCT?
	Attrition: predictable attrition’s can be made up
	Validity issue: generalizable in other circumstances with the similar protocol which is difficult to achieve
	
Did the intervention effect sustain in this study? How would this affect the implication of this study?
	Long-term intervention is needed
	Pre-condition of individuals will affect the analysis 
	
Observational study
	Not suited for causal judgement 
	Confounding variables can affect the analysis 
	
DID 
	Definition: differences in pre/post treatment and experimental/control comparisons
	Assumptions: 
		Trends on baseline status should be paralleled 
		Comparison group should change at the same rate
		Common-shock: unrelated events should have the same effects on both experimental and control groups
	Questions
		What are the two differences that this study was contrasting
1.	Policy types
2.	Characteristic groups
		What did county fixed effects and the ear fixed effects do
			Controlling for time-varying factors (such as policy change) and cultural and demographic factors 
		Why is there a need to adopt a comparison group
		Other trends may correlates with immigration enforcement policies (other time-varying factors may affect outcome). What did the authors do to address this

Regression discontinuity 
	Condition: Cut-off point in index or parameters; beneficiaries and non beneficiaries should be continuous 
	Intuitive explanation: the potential beneficiaries (units) just above the cut off point are very similar to the potential beneficiaries just below the cut off point. 

Instrumental variables 
	Related to IV not related to DV
	
PSM
	Controlling for covariates

### Meaning making

Perception of health: 
	Identity: I live a healthy life style
	Health: living a healthy lifestyle protects people from illness
	Global goals: desire to live a long time with robust health

Discrepancies between situational and global meaning
	Global meaning: what one believes and desires
        Beliefs: 
            Health (physical well-being, mortality, morbidity) and well-being; 
            Illness violate important global beliefs (fairness, benevolence, predictability of the world and sense of invulnerability and personal control)
        Goals (relationships, work, religion, knowledge, and achievement)
            Health: physical health 
            Illness: violates individuals' goals for their current lives and their plans for the future 
        General sense of meaning in life: 
	Situational meaning: appraised meaning
        Primary appraisal: one's beliefs in ability to control events affect whether potentially stressful events are appraised primarily as challenges or as threats. 
        Secondary appraisal: evaluates the possibilities for coping and expectations regarding outcomes. 
        Reappraisal of meaning (meaning making as coping):
            Modify the meaning of an event to make it consistent with preexisting beliefs and goals 
            Modify relevant beliefs and goals to accommodate the event
	Discrepancy creates distress and gives rise to efforts to reduce the discrepancy and resultant distress
		Coping strategies 
            Process: change one's global beliefs and goals with revised identity, growth, or world views to improve the fit between the appraised meaning of the stressor and global meaning (low control situations such as trauma, loss and serious illness may not be directly coped with)
			Types: problem-focused, emotion-focused
			
Scenarios
    1. People with mental illness appraise the meaning of their illness based on information they receive from sources such as their health providers. Their global meaning is that they can manage to control the illness by receiving conventional interventions or seeking help from their health providers; they have anticipated outcome in future and general sense of control over their lives. In order to reduce discrepancy between two types of meanings, one may gradually shift views of illness in a more positive direction or reconsider life goals or life meaning in light of the illness. 
    2. When confronted with the fact of a loved one's death, the initial meaning of that eventual meanings that the individual may derive from it are influenced by the survivor's global meaning. Global meaning in terms of beliefs and goals regarding the deceased and their relationship, expectations about how and why things happen, perceptions of vulnerability to such events, and so on influence the survivor's understanding of the situation. From the perspective of stress and coping theory, situational meaning involves the appraisal of person-environment transactions, which in turn influences how people cope with the demands of those transactions and their outcomes. Traumatic events overwhelmingly beyond one's experiential readiness (primary appraisal) can lead one to question the viability of his or her world and self views. People with negative attitudes towards themselves perceive themselves not being able to adopt resources for coping with such a stressful situation (secondary appraisal). One would use reappraisal process to decrease the threatening and harmful aspects of the event and increase it positive aspects.

        Reflective Practice For Leadership (RPL).pdf


    ## Types 
    1 Instructional design virtual learning community (Law, et al., 2011)
        1 Motivation to participate virtual learning communities 
        2 Factors for successful community building
        3 Individual characteristics and group characteristics on community participation and knowledge building 
        4 Structure of instructional design learning community: skills, knowledge, identity, values, epistemology (justifications and methods of proof that legitimize actions and claims within the community) (Shaffer, 2006)
        5 Definition of reflective setting: 
            1 novice professionals engage in authentic, messy, and ill-structured problems under the supervision of more experienced mentors
            2 the ability to shift from standard, skilled performance to a more analytical and experimental mode when an unexpected complication arises during practice 
    
    ## Reflective Group Structure and Content 
    1 Virtual learning (community) meeting (Law, et al., 2011)
        1 Past experiences
        2 Prior knowledge for collective prior knowledge 
        3 Self perceptions
    2 Action Learning Conversation Protocol (Marsick & Maltbia, 2006) and Reflective Model (Boud, Keogh, & Walker, 1985)
        1 structured conversation in 3 phases: 
            1 framing/engaging (skills, action, and behaviors): 
                1 preparing (10 min): write a key challenge in the form of a question, background information
                2 sharing (10 min each): share each one's challenge and the team works on one challenge each time
                3 clarifying (10 min each): peers help by asking objective questions to clarify the context and background information 
                4 requesting support: receive support from peers and supervisor 
            2 Advancing (knowledge): 
                1 Question storming (15 min): 
                    asking reflective, interpretive, decisional questions (Weinstein, 1995)
                    team members think silently and write down questions before share in a round-robin process (Adams, 2004)
                2 exploring assumptions (15 min): silently write down assumptions others hold and verify with the person. The procedure of ladder of inference is used to identify appropriate assumptions (Argyris, 1985)
                3 reframing (15 min): reframing the original question. Each reframes the challenges and share revised question in a round-robin fashion with the help
                4 committing (15 min): commit to actions after the question is reframed with verified assumptions
            3 Disengaging (feelings, attitudes, and beliefs): 
                1 summarizing key discoveries
                2 reviewing personal commitments
                3 checking for alignment in the group

         
        
    ## Reflective group techniques (Law, et al., 2011)
        1 Interaction between individual characteristics and group characteristics (how individual contributes to the group while group influence knowledge construction process)
        2 Group discussion online
        3 Post one initial reaction towards the weekly Readings
        4 Interact with at least one member in the online discussion forum
        5 Post a reflection to synthesize learnings from readings and discussion

    ## Theory
    1 Levels of operations: 
        1 unconscious or conscious impulses with aggressive behaviors are correlated with one's cognitive and emotional experiences 
        2 supervisor facilitate social workers to develop their capacity to think and feel when faced with impulses and top self defeating patterns
        3 supervisor and staff operate on conscious, covert and unconscious levels
        4 supervisor creates more interactions between staff
    2 Reflection improves quality 
        1 reflection helps identify underlying values, beliefs, and assumptions and enables people to see how they can change a situation by changing the way they frame it and act on it 
        2 structured conversation protocol enable supervisor in action learning programs to see how reflection could improve their thinking and the solutions to challenges in which they were engaged


    ## Limitations
    1 Older generation perceives virtual learning community may keep them isolated and segregated in "electronic communication"





### 181019 supervision seminar 
1. Meta analysis on dementia interventions (with Reynold in November?)

### 180924 on meta analysis

1. Psychosocial interventions for elderly diagnosed of Alzheimer's
1.1 Objective: compare the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions conducted for Chinese population and Western population diagnosed of Alzheimer's Disease from 2010 to 2018
1.2 Methods: 
    1.2.1 Chinese literature (CNKI, VIP, Wanfang) and English literature (Pubmed, Cochrane, Medline)
    1.2.2 Inclusion criteria: RCT, screening tools (MMSE, ADL, QOL), diagnosed by ICD or DSM, etc.
    1.2.3 Exclusion criteria: non-RCR, no comparison group, Chinese herb and medicine treatment, pharmacological intervention, comorbidity, etc.
    1.2.4 Year range: 2008-2018
1.3 Statistics:
    1.3.1 publication bias analysis
    1.3.2 Forest plot for effectiveness comparison of between group (Chinese population and foreign population) on demographics and treatment effects
    1.3.3 meta-regression: whether demographics and Western/Chinese populations have differences on their treatment effects
1.4 similar studies
    1.4.1 Meta-analysis of nonpharmacological interventions for neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. (Brodaty, et al.,2012)
    1.4.2 Meta‐analysis of psychosocial interventions for caregivers of people with dementia. (Brodaty, et al., 2003)
    1.4.3 Nonpharmacological Therapies in Alzheimer’s Disease: A Systematic Review of Efficacy (prior to 2008). (Olazarán, et al., 2010) 
1.5 Questions:
    1.5.1 Would comparing Chinese and foreign populations be a narrow topic considering to publish in an English journal?
    1.5.2 My assumption to compare two populations is that people's treatment (psychosocial intervention/medication) and residence (living at home or community/institution) preference are different. Would comparison be worth doing?

argument: 
    By policy and by choice - no diagnosis, medication, medical care
    Settings: 
    Literature: meta-analysis and cross-country

        1.	Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI)
    ii.	Meaning-making (the restoration of meaning in the context of highly stressful situations)
        1.	There is increasing consensus that meaning making (i.e., “the restoration of meaning in the context of highly stressful situations;” Park, 2010, p. 257) can represent a central aspect of coping and adjustment in these contexts. From a meaning making perspective, challenges emerge if the reality of a stressor cannot be adaptively assimilated into global meaning (e.g., preexisting beliefs/values, goals) and/or the person cannot accommodate aspects of their global system to situationally construct meaning out of the experience (Holland, 2015). These violations of meaning can be quite distressing and lead to strained efforts to reconcile one’s appraisal of the stressor and global meaning, which may manifest as MDD or other mental health problems that prompt individuals to seek psychotherapy (Kendler, Karkowski, & Prescott, 1999; Park 2010).
        2.	Help clients (carers) make sense of significant stressors and regain a sense of purpose and direction in life (Clark, 1995).
        3.	Meaning made [Chinese version of the Positive Aspects of Caregiving (PAC)]: Affirming self, Enriching life 
        4.	Meaning search: situational meaning [Finding Meaning Through Caregiving Scale (FMTCS) – loss/powerfulness + provisional meaning], global meaning (self-in-world, life goals, sense of life purpose)
2.	Family: social assistance-like arrangement: residential care, home care
    i.	caregiving intensity
    ii.	caregiving needs [Activity of Daily Living (ADL)]
    iii.	physical health
    iv.	mental health
    v.	part/full-time work
    vi.	income, income security, social security 
    vii.	gender, age, marital status, education level, living arrangement, financial status, physical distance (co-resident caregivers), 
3.	Government: 
    i.	Tasks: cost management, program evaluation, administered means-tested assisting program 
    ii.	Policies: health, social, employment policies 
4.	Market: economic values of output by government and input by care recipients and carers; caregiving evaluated in terms of changes in aging and social values;  impact of care allowance on the labor force participation of women caregivers; community care rather than institutionalization is financially more cost-effective (economically and quality-wised); 
5.	Voluntary sectors: volunteers, organizations, community care, NGO, NPO; charitable or religious organizations; 
6.	Social workers 
    i.	reflective groups
7.	Social background: social cost, social pressures, social insurance system, policy beneficiary to female;

    metacognitive and cognitive: affective, developmental, personal and social, individual differences
    psychological background: beliefs, emotions, motivations

Generations [baby boomer: 1946-1964; generation X: 1965-1980]
    1.	Sense of loss, self centered; Tendency of searching meaning; Sense of meaning made 
    2.	Well-being ~ Sense of loss + meaning searching

Interactions, Meaning-making Model:
    1.	Examine distribution for responsibilities of long-term care between the state, the market, and the family
    2.	Factors for participating in paid labor market and informal caregiving
    3.	Caregiving intensity 

Effects:
    1.	Substitution effect: time needs for informal care work reduces labor market participation
    2.	Income effect: high cost of caregiving induce carers to increase labor market participation to earn more income
    3.	Demand for respite work: work as respite to avoid heavy caring work and mental pressure
    4.	Disadvantage in job market due to high rate of absenteeism

Problems:
    1.	Opportunity costs of caregivers’ foregone earnings and leisure
    2.	Expenditure in household
    3.	Health effects and impact on marriages
    4.	Reduction of work hours

1.	Discussion
    ○	Country review of the United States and Japan 
        ■	looking into literature 
        ■	to finish next Monday
    ○	Data mining (web scraping with Python) on social media on meaning-making
        ■	reading two books: Mastering Social Media Mining with Python (Bonzanini), Python Social Media Analytics (Chatterjee & Krystyanczuk)
        ■	to find the application for the analysis of meaning-making
        ■	association of "meaning making" or "meaning searching" with people's understanding, definition, and attitude while recording demographic info of carers through social media (websites, blogs, forum, social networking platform such as fb and twitter, pinterest, youtube), or,
        ■	evaluate feedbacks and responses from carers to a list of meaning-making-related topics
        ■	to contact Dr. Luo Hao on programming and coding issues
    ○	Systematic review on meaning making (and interventions for Alzheimers)
        ■	to check with Huiying and Jieling on their work in regards to systematic review
        ■	to work on as class assignments
2.	Plan for next session [could be earlier since our project is moving faster in this stage]
    ○	to report analytical methods for data mining of meaning making
    ○	to report primary preparation for systematic review on meaning making
3.	Questions:
    ○	Would you please help coordinate Dr. Luo in this data mining project? I guess we need to have a meeting on this topic, because I am not quite familiar with meaing-making even though I learned the theory and its basic construct. [my suggestion is do a literature review on meaning making & carer first; then we would have much more confidence what to “mine” in the data sea. For the technical side, no worries, I will link you to Dr. Luo]
    ○	You mentioned questionnaire related to meaning-making (I couldn't hear that part clearly due to signal issues)? Are you suggesting to design part of the questionnaires based on the result of data mining? [I mean if you could identify new framework on meaning making, or other key variables that you would like to be included for your thesis, I will support you. But time is important – the project data collection would start late this year or early next year. Again, literature review is important.]

### 180906  


1.   	Rational to select countries under review

2.   	Under each country - United Kingdom
    2.1.	Policy name, time of enactment, weblink, etc.
        Policy Name: Carer’s Allowance (Invalid Care Allowance until 1986)
        Time of enactment: 1976
        Weblink: https://www.gov.uk/carers-allowance
    2.2.	Rational and objective
        Carer's Allowance is a means-tested, non-contributory benefit in the United Kingdom payable to people who care for a disabled person for at least 35 hours a week. It was first established as Invalid Care Allowance in 1976, not eligible for married women until the occurrence of an unlawful sexual discrimination by the European Court in 1986 in the case of Jackie Drake.
    2.3.	Defining eligibility
        The following conditions for a carer need to be met: 1) spend at least 35 hours a week caring for a disabled person (one doesn't have to live with them or be related to them); 2) care for someone who receives the higher-rate or middle-rate care component of Disability Living Allowance, either rate of Personal Independence Payment daily living component, or any rate of Attendance Allowance; 3) do not earn more than £120 a week (after deductions); 4) are not in full-time education (or 21 hours a week or more); 5) age of 16 and above; 6) have been in England, Scotland or Wales for at least 2 of the last 3 years (this doesn’t apply if you’re a refugee or have humanitarian protection status), or normally live in England, Scotland or Wales, or you live abroad as a member of the armed forces 7) not subject to immigration control.
        Noted: elderly shall include all age groups
    2.4.	Amount
        Carer’s Allowance is worth £64.60 per week (for April 2018-19) and is usually paid every four weeks
    2.5.	Administrative procedure
        1) Contact Carer’s Allowance Unit on 0800 731 0297 (text phone: 0800 731 0317) or visit GOV.UK to download a claim form or make a claim online. Local Age UK can assist when needed.
        2) Written decision and effective date will be informed if the claim is approved. A challenge can be made if the claim is turned down.
        3) Keep the Carer’s Allowance Unit informed and updated whenever there is a change of caregiving condition, including but not limited to: a) one changes, starts or leaves job; b) one starts earning more than £120 a week; c) one stops being a carer; d) one takes a holiday or goes into hospital - even if one arranges care while away; e) the person to care for goes into hospital or takes a holiday
    2.6.	Welfare regime/GDP/etc.
        Welfare regime mainly aims toward the promotion of health, education, employment, and social security. This regime causes increase in expenditure and a bigger range of government responsibility as well as in taxation, regulation of industry, food and housing.
    2.7.	Evaluation report/debate;
        1) Expenditure and burden for government take away the awareness of citizens’ personal responsibility and result in welfare dependency with which people become lack of motivation or incentives in working and personal development.
        2) Allowance, being stringent in its condition, is provided with heavy and regular caring duties for caregivers who has to give up their own work or personal business later on. All conditions of criteria allow a small percentage of carers to receive the allowance. Only under 1% of UK population received a Carer’s Allowance in 2008.
        3) Identification of targeted carers who are eligible to receive allowance can be administratively complicated and infeasible due to its various requirement to evaluate, in which some can be difficult to assess in the real setting.
    2.8.	Anything related.

## Model Fitness:
    matrix: r1 * r2 * r3 ...
    matrix fitness: goodness of fit statistics:
        chi square (least square, estimated non-centrality): <<
        RMSEA (root mean square error of approximation): < 0.05(0.08)
            90% CI for RMSEA
            p value for test of close fit (RMSAE < 0.05)
        NNFI (non-normed fit index ~ TLI): > 0.9
        CFI (comparative fit index ~ RNI):  > 0.9
        AIC
    df = [non-duplicating elements, p(p+1)/2] - [估计参数 estimated parameters]
        9*10/2 - 21 (9 lambda/factor loading and 9 endogenous variables, 3 correlations, ) = 24
        bigger df indicates simpler model
    Indices for lambda-x
        modification: maximum modification index is 41.35 for element (8,1) indicates reassignment of element to suggested factor will bring down chi square (better for the model)
        standardized solution: with standardized index [0,1]
        (structure) variance of item = theta^2 + loadings^2
    Embedded model



## EFA & CFA
    EFA - principal component analysis:
        eigenvalues (>1): overall variance (up to the number of variables) explained by each loadings
        scree test: greatest change in slope
        meaningful dimensions
    - varimax: rotated (uncorrelated) factor loadings
        unique var column: measurement error, not accounted for in any factor provided
    - promax: rotated (correlated) factor loadings

    CFA -

## modeling categories: on multiple DVs, IVs (factor structure and factor relations), errors
    categories:
        measurement model: IV ~ DV
        structural model: DV ~ DV (factors)
    functions:
        tolerance: errors as endogenous variables
        model fit and comparison:
        regression, CFA, EFA, ANOVA...



## LISREl
    FI: fixed model
        variables with no correlations (r = 0)
        set/fixed metric/scale:
            no metric/unit
            fixed metric (with no standardized unit metrics) - set as 1
                fixed variance: variances of all FACTORS set as 1; loadings of free estimate while others are fixed
                fixed loading: one of the ITEM in each factor set as 1; the first item (for example) set as fixed whie the other items in each factor are free
    FR: free variance
        parameters to estimate of uncertainty/questioned
    Methods:
        fixed variance:
        fixed loading:
    DA: data
    LX: loadings (lambda) of variables, FU - full, FI - ; LX21, LX42, LX 63
    MA: matrix - KM (correlated matrix), CM (covariate matrix)
    MI: modified index
    MO: model
    NI: number of variables
    NK: number of categories
    NO: number of cases
    NX: number of variables
    PH: correlations among factors, ST - diagonal
    TD: error, DI - diagonal, FR - free
    OU: output
    SS/SC: standardized score
    VA: fix loadings; 'VA 1 LX1,1 LX4,2 LX7,3'

    lambda (factor loadings), PHI (factor matrix), THETA-DELTA (errors for each items)
        parameters: correlation/error coefficients
            SE parameters being 1 indicate the item all accounted for in errors
        SE: standard error
        t-value: paramter/SE; >2 ~ significantly different from 0

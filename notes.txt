## 190120 meanings

Questions: to interview 100 young man who want to become entrepreneur. If you have sufficient fundings and another 99 man force to join you, what prooject or program you want to do?

context: political, social, cultural, economic, historical, gender, religious, spiritual, family, psychological
process: factors, causes, turning point, 
stance: 
lens: 

Ontology: philosophical assumptions about nature (subjective/objective)
Objectivism: objective 
Interpretivism: subjective definition, 
Constructivism: what construct reality
Empirical: evidence 

Positivism: observed, sensed, measured
Negativism: hypothetized, imagined 

Social constructivism: socially constrcuted meanings, social contexts and components; create systems for meaningfully understanding their worlds and experiences
Symbolic interation: symbolic meanings created; subjective interpretation of symbols


single older parent-primary child caregiver dyads
individual parent-child dyads (life-course perspective): a parent and a child interaction

proximal factors: 
distal factors: 

instrumental care, navigation help, 

Family economics (care as resource allocation and transfer): division of labor, distribution 
Care giving (care givers – care partners)
Long term care (long term living)
Ind. parent – dyad (Bi-directional exchange)
Proximal factor vs. distal factors
Family life discourse
Navigation help
Early life influence – early life human capital investment 



Perspectives 
1.Unique determinants vs. common determinants
2.Perceived social discrimination vs actual experience
3.Manifest vs latent (stress); implicit, explicit
4.One direction vs bi-directional exchanges
5.Behaviour as facts  vs meaning of experience
6.Individual as a unit vs social relationships 
7.Focus on the dyad & ignore the family as a whole
8.Focus on particular types of institutions …. & ignore others? religion, education, gender, age group, ethnicity, community, work, political parties, financial institution, 
9.The centrality of economic considerations & ignore others? will, relationships, autonomy, love, 
10.Focus on proximal & ignore distal forces? early life influences, temporary impact

Limitations:
1.Lack of respect for cultural diversity …. & essentialising culture? material, spiritual, memory, values, norms, roles, identity, rituals, failial piety
2.Refers to stereotypes … participants as passive rather than active? carer, care receipt, partners, 
3.Process: lack analysis of power dynamics & … - power structure, determinants, contexts,  
4.Focus on a specific time point & ignore life course, family life course? life course
5.Whose voices are being heard? Whose voice are being excluded? Who will benefit? disadvantaged, under-previleged, biased voice, 
6.Social categories as discreet and unitary categories - gender, LGBTQ+
7.Based on Western concepts? 
8.Lack gender sensitivity? Feminist standpoint?
9.Context - 



### 181120 HLM
Development 
~ individual: SES, parenting styles
~ community: infrastructure, health care, 
~ policy: welfare, allowance, insurance

vs. clustered 

alcohol abuse
~ individual: stress, trauma, growing experience 
~ family: 
~ neibourhood: culture, lique stores, tax, violence, community SES  
~ society: tax, permission, cost

HLM avoid false regression on the clustered data points
  Data analyzed if indiivduals selected from different [IVs]
  Data from stratified sampled dataset
  applied in the fields of education, public health, social work, politics

OLS/Classical regression
  Assumptions:
    Observations are independent 
    Errors (unexplained variance) is random

  y = bx + a + e
   b: change in y associated with a one unit change in X
   a: the value of y when x=0

   ICC : BG^2/(BG^2+WG^2) > 0.25 # between group variance is noticable ONLY in slope variance model
   


### 181113 

1 in 20 variable can be "significant"

data mining for theory building
  backward elimination
  non-linear relationship
    1. analyze every level of every potential predictor (IV)
    2. interaction of all splited-level IVs 
    3. decision tree to find split-point for each IV - boosting algorithm
    
### 181106 Big data
About big data 
  Characteristics: 
    Volume (big data): multiple terabytes and petabytes
    velocity (speed of change): smartphones and sensors, real-time Analytics
    variety (different forms of data source)
    veracity (uncertainty of data)
    value (business value)
  Differences between statistical learning and machine learning 
    rule-based programming
    data set size
    assumption based
    inference of prediction 
    good understanding of data
  Parametric methods 
    assumptions with function describing relationship of IVs and DV
    not match the real relationship
    overfitting may occur
  Non-parametric methods
    no assumption with low-error estimation 
    need a very large observations
  Flexibility (low to high) X Interpretability (high to low)
    Subset selection Lasso, least squares, generalized additive models trees, bagging and boosting, support vector machines
  Supervised and unsupervised learning
    Supervised:  linear regression, logistic regression, GAM,boosting, and support vector machine.
    Unsupervised:  cluster analysis, principal component analysis, Propensity Score Analysis
    Semi-supervised learning: predictor measurement (X) for m (<n) and n-m, response (Y) measurement for m only. 
  ROC
    ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) is a graph showing the performance of a classification model at all classification thresholds. This curve plots two parameters: True Positive Rate, False Positive Rate
  AUC
    AUC stands for "Area under the ROC Curve." That is, AUC measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve (think integral calculus) from (0,0) to (1,1).
  Questions
    1. NLP content analysis
    2. AUC vs GLM, which and when to use
    3. can we use machine learning to determine fixed effects and random effects? usually compare AIC; how to define the model fitting and compare them?

### 181030 Qualitative analysis
Epistemological positions
	Discuss the relationship between known and knower
	Positivism: one version of reality observed by the knower
  Social constructivism: subjectivity
Person-in-context 
  Subjective meanings - lived experience - context/environment 
  
Deductive (quantitative) / Inductive (qualitative)

Theoretical framework / theories / manifestation / rationality 

Gap-driven vs Goal-oriented

Naturalism (ethnography)
  good for policy implication 
Phenomenology 
  rely on personal Narratives
Discourse analysis
  knowledge and ideologies are always in the making 

Grounded Theory
  Participatory Action Research
    Charmaz's Constructivist Grounded Theory
      Multiple realities

Non-probability sampling
	
	

### 181009 Scale development 
Basic attributes of scales
Conceptualize the target construct
  identify latent construct 
  literature review: 
Develop the initial item pool
  creation of an item pool
Select items to form the scale
Evaluate the psychometric properties of the scale
Data collection
  inclusion of comparison scales
  

### 181002 Causal inference

Validity: external and internal	
Effectiveness of supporting group: 
	Single case study: trend analysis
	RCT: effectiveness evaluation; compliance in RCT can be difficult to achieve
	Pre-experimental study design:
	Selection bias:
Inferring causality
	Cause must precede the effect in time
The two variables are empirically correlated with on another
The observed empirical correlation between the two variables that 
Threats to internal validity
	History, maturation, testing, instrumentation changes, statistical regression, selection bias, ambiguity regarding the direction of causal inference
Conterfactuals
	Find the alternative possibility of unconditional path

Experimental Design
	Randomized group distribution, - randomization still exist
	Contamination: cases within the same cluster may intervene each other 
	Controlling variables: covariates may be influential in the model but assumed not

Hot Et al. (2016)
What do you learn from the flow diagram?
	Describe process and details 
	CONSORT statement: require to report for RCT 

Why is there a need to compare characteristics on the baseline?
	Table 1 baseline characteristics description
	Demonstrate randomization as it should be balanced

What are common challenges in conducting an RCT?
	Attrition: predictable attrition’s can be made up
	Validity issue: generalizable in other circumstances with the similar protocol which is difficult to achieve
	
Did the intervention effect sustain in this study? How would this affect the implication of this study?
	Long-term intervention is needed
	Pre-condition of individuals will affect the analysis 
	
Observational study
	Not suited for causal judgement 
	Confounding variables can affect the analysis 
	
DID 
	Definition: differences in pre/post treatment and experimental/control comparisons
	Assumptions: 
		Trends on baseline status should be paralleled 
		Comparison group should change at the same rate
		Common-shock: unrelated events should have the same effects on both experimental and control groups
	Questions
		What are the two differences that this study was contrasting
1.	Policy types
2.	Characteristic groups
		What did county fixed effects and the ear fixed effects do
			Controlling for time-varying factors (such as policy change) and cultural and demographic factors 
		Why is there a need to adopt a comparison group
		Other trends may correlates with immigration enforcement policies (other time-varying factors may affect outcome). What did the authors do to address this

Regression discontinuity 
	Condition: Cut-off point in index or parameters; beneficiaries and non beneficiaries should be continuous 
	Intuitive explanation: the potential beneficiaries (units) just above the cut off point are very similar to the potential beneficiaries just below the cut off point. 

Instrumental variables 
	Related to IV not related to DV
	
PSM
	Controlling for covariates

2. subjective aging and health, a meta analysis
  [micro] meta regression health ~ age group, caregiver's age group, gender, (lower) socioeconomic strata, racial or ethnic (minority) groups, congruency or incongruency of subjective aging
  [macro] meta regression health ~ age norm and age related expectations, structure lag between the needs and competencies of aging individuals and opportunities provided by society 
  [mezzo] meta regression health ~ generational differences between caregivers of baby boomers and X in terms of their interaction with elderly

### Meaning making #############################################################

## 181129
culture and mind (instituted and mental models)
  meaning making function of culture fails in anthropoligy as the sentient agent was eliminated along with psychological meaning thus leaving logical meaning. 
  
  Susanne Langer: observation <- meaning
    "Langer was referring to philosophy's retreat from questions of ontology and metaphysics and its turning to the problem of symbolic representation and its relation to meaning and truth."
  

# Infants’ Meaning-Making and the Development of Mental Health Problems

symbolic interaction in making meaning 

  infants (with subsystems of brain, physiologic processes, and behaviors) 
  experiences/interaction with internal and external worlds -> representations (meanings)
  meaning + positive/negative feedback = new systemic properties, developmental capacities 
  open system + resources (energy and information) = development (increase coherence and complexity) (Prigogine & Stengers, 1984)

## 181029

Perception of health: 
	Identity: I live a healthy life style
	Health: living a healthy lifestyle protects people from illness
	Global goals: desire to live a long time with robust health

Discrepancies between situational and global meaning
	Global meaning: what one believes and desires
    Beliefs: 
      Health (physical well-being, mortality, morbidity) and well-being; 
      Illness violate important global beliefs (fairness, benevolence, predictability of the world and sense of invulnerability and personal control)
    Goals (relationships, work, religion, knowledge, and achievement)
      Health: physical health 
      Illness: violates individuals' goals for their current lives and their plans for the future 
    General sense of meaning in life: 
	Situational meaning: appraised meaning
    Primary appraisal: one's beliefs in ability to control events affect whether potentially stressful events are appraised primarily as challenges or as threats. 
    Secondary appraisal: evaluates the possibilities for coping and expectations regarding outcomes. 
    Reappraisal of meaning (meaning making as coping):
      Modify the meaning of an event to make it consistent with preexisting beliefs and goals 
      Modify relevant beliefs and goals to accommodate the event
	Discrepancy creates distress and gives rise to efforts to reduce the discrepancy and resultant distress
		Coping strategies 
      Process: change one's global beliefs and goals with revised identity, growth, or world views to improve the fit between the appraised meaning of the stressor and global meaning (low control situations such as trauma, loss and serious illness may not be directly coped with)
			Types: problem-focused, emotion-focused
			
Scenarios
  1. People with mental illness appraise the meaning of their illness based on information they receive from sources such as their health providers. Their global meaning is that they can manage to control the illness by receiving conventional interventions or seeking help from their health providers; while the situational meaning is that their symptoms worsen gradually and may not recover. They have anticipated outcome in future and general sense of control over their lives however the reality cannot meet their anticipation. In order to reduce discrepancy between two types of meanings, one may gradually shift views of illness in a more positive direction (believing other ways such as being optimistic, doing more physical activities, or becoming satisfactory with their lives) or reconsider life goals (they enjoy things that they physically can achieve and not expect anything that they can no longer achieve such as running with disability but they can still enjoy movies and food) or life meaning in light of the illness (illness allows one to value time and life more; illness restricts one's unhealthy eating habit). 

  2. When confronted with the fact of a loved one's death, the initial meaning of that eventual meanings that the individual may derive from it are influenced by the survivor's global meaning. Global meaning in terms of beliefs and goals regarding the deceased and their relationship, expectations about how and why things happen, perceptions of vulnerability to such events, and so on influence the survivor's understanding of the situation. From the perspective of stress and coping theory, situational meaning involves the appraisal of person-environment transactions, which in turn influences how people cope with the demands of those transactions and their outcomes. Traumatic events overwhelmingly beyond one's experiential readiness (primary appraisal) can lead one to question the viability of his or her world and self views. People with negative attitudes towards themselves perceive themselves not being able to adopt resources for coping with such a stressful situation (secondary appraisal of situational meaning being congruent with global meaning or not). One would use reappraisal process to decrease the threatening and harmful aspects of the event and increase its positive aspects.
  
CST questions
  1.	Is there a meta analysis research on CST comparing pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for dementia? 
  2.	Does CST significantly have more effects on dementia comparing with other non-pharmacological interventions in RCT experiments?
  3.	Does CST and relevant measurement include information of locus of control and coping strategies?
 


Perception of health: 
	Identity: I live a healthy life style
	Health: living a healthy lifestyle protects people from illness
	Global goals: desire to live a long time with robust health

Discrepancies between situational and global meaning
	Situational meaning: appraised meaning
	Global meaning: what one believes and desires
	Discrepancy creates distress and gives rise to efforts to reduce the discrepancy and resultant distress
		Coping strategies: 
			problem-focused
			emotion-focused
			non-solvable: low control situations such as trauma, loss and serious illness

Caregiving allowance ~ women (gender study) incentive for formal care; economic values performed, reduced labor market participation, structure of labor market, caregiving (formal or informal) for elderly (disabled or general) is effective

Meaning Making Model:

System Theory + Reader-Response Theory (Caregiving model * Generational Model * Meaning Making Model) - Long-term care system: 
1.	Carer:
  i.	Psychological distress
    1.	Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI)
  ii.	Meaning-making (the restoration of meaning in the context of highly stressful situations)
    1.	There is increasing consensus that meaning making (i.e., “the restoration of meaning in the context of highly stressful situations;” Park, 2010, p. 257) can represent a central aspect of coping and adjustment in these contexts. From a meaning making perspective, challenges emerge if the reality of a stressor cannot be adaptively assimilated into global meaning (e.g., preexisting beliefs/values, goals) and/or the person cannot accommodate aspects of their global system to situationally construct meaning out of the experience (Holland, 2015). These violations of meaning can be quite distressing and lead to strained efforts to reconcile one’s appraisal of the stressor and global meaning, which may manifest as MDD or other mental health problems that prompt individuals to seek psychotherapy (Kendler, Karkowski, & Prescott, 1999; Park 2010).
    2.	Help clients (carers) make sense of significant stressors and regain a sense of purpose and direction in life (Clark, 1995).
    3.	Meaning made [Chinese version of the Positive Aspects of Caregiving (PAC)]: Affirming self, Enriching life 
    4.	Meaning search: situational meaning [Finding Meaning Through Caregiving Scale (FMTCS) – loss/powerfulness + provisional meaning], global meaning (self-in-world, life goals, sense of life purpose)
2.	Family: social assistance-like arrangement: residential care, home care
  i.	caregiving intensity
  ii.	caregiving needs [Activity of Daily Living (ADL)]
  iii.	physical health
  iv.	mental health
  v.	part/full-time work
  vi.	income, income security, social security 
  vii.	gender, age, marital status, education level, living arrangement, financial status, physical distance (co-resident caregivers), 
3.	Government: 
  i.	Tasks: cost management, program evaluation, administered means-tested assisting program 
  ii.	Policies: health, social, employment policies 
4.	Market: economic values of output by government and input by care recipients and carers; caregiving evaluated in terms of changes in aging and social values; impact of care allowance on the labor force participation of women caregivers; community care rather than institutionalization is financially more cost-effective (economically and quality-wised); 
5.	Voluntary sectors: volunteers, organizations, community care, NGO, NPO; charitable or religious organizations; 
6.	Social workers 
  i.	reflective groups
7.	Social background: social cost, social pressures, social insurance system, policy beneficiary to female; 
* Reader-Response Theory
  metacognitive and cognitive: affective, developmental, personal and social, individual differences
  psychological background: beliefs, emotions, motivations
  developmental, personal, social and individual differences
  social motives
  

Generations [baby boomer: 1946-1964; generation X: 1965-1980]
  1.	Sense of loss, self centered; Tendency of searching meaning; Sense of meaning made 
  2.	Well-being ~ Sense of loss + meaning searching

Interactions, Meaning-making Model:
  1.	Examine distribution for responsibilities of long-term care between the state, the market, and the family
  2.	Factors for participating in paid labor market and informal caregiving
  3.	Caregiving intensity 

Effects:
  1.	Substitution effect: time needs for informal care work reduces labor market participation
  2.	Income effect: high cost of caregiving induce carers to increase labor market participation to earn more income
  3.	Demand for respite work: work as respite to avoid heavy caring work and mental pressure
  4.	Disadvantage in job market due to high rate of absenteeism

Problems:
  1.	Opportunity costs of caregivers’ foregone earnings and leisure
  2.	Expenditure in household
  3.	Health effects and impact on marriages
  4.	Reduction of work hours

Caregiving relationship 
  1.	Care recipient and informal caregiver:

    Reflective Practice For Leadership (RPL).pdf
  ## Types 
  1 Instructional design virtual learning community (Law, et al., 2011)
    1 Motivation to participate virtual learning communities 
    2 Factors for successful community building
    3 Individual characteristics and group characteristics on community participation and knowledge building 
    4 Structure of instructional design learning community: skills, knowledge, identity, values, epistemology (justifications and methods of proof that legitimize actions and claims within the community) (Shaffer, 2006)
    5 Definition of reflective setting: 
      1 novice professionals engage in authentic, messy, and ill-structured problems under the supervision of more experienced mentors
      2 the ability to shift from standard, skilled performance to a more analytical and experimental mode when an unexpected complication arises during practice 
  ## Reflective Group Structure and Content 
  1 Virtual learning (community) meeting (Law, et al., 2011)
    1 Past experiences
    2 Prior knowledge for collective prior knowledge 
    3 Self perceptions
  2 Action Learning Conversation Protocol (Marsick & Maltbia, 2006) and Reflective Model (Boud, Keogh, & Walker, 1985)
    1 structured conversation in 3 phases: 
      1 framing/engaging (skills, action, and behaviors): 
        1 preparing (10 min): write a key challenge in the form of a question, background information
        2 sharing (10 min each): share each one's challenge and the team works on one challenge each time
        3 clarifying (10 min each): peers help by asking objective questions to clarify the context and background information 
        4 requesting support: receive support from peers and supervisor 
      2 Advancing (knowledge): 
        1 Question storming (15 min): 
          asking reflective, interpretive, decisional questions (Weinstein, 1995)
          team members think silently and write down questions before share in a round-robin process (Adams, 2004)
        2 exploring assumptions (15 min): silently write down assumptions others hold and verify with the person. The procedure of ladder of inference is used to identify appropriate assumptions (Argyris, 1985)
        3 reframing (15 min): reframing the original question. Each reframes the challenges and share revised question in a round-robin fashion with the help
        4 committing (15 min): commit to actions after the question is reframed with verified assumptions
      3 Disengaging (feelings, attitudes, and beliefs): 
        1 summarizing key discoveries
        2 reviewing personal commitments
        3 checking for alignment in the group
    
  ## Reflective group techniques (Law, et al., 2011)
    1 Interaction between individual characteristics and group characteristics (how individual contributes to the group while group influence knowledge construction process)
    2 Group discussion online
    3 Post one initial reaction towards the weekly Readings
    4 Interact with at least one member in the online discussion forum
    5 Post a reflection to synthesize learnings from readings and discussion

  ## Theory
  1 Levels of operations: 
    1 unconscious or conscious impulses with aggressive behaviors are correlated with one's cognitive and emotional experiences 
    2 supervisor facilitate social workers to develop their capacity to think and feel when faced with impulses and top self defeating patterns
    3 supervisor and staff operate on conscious, covert and unconscious levels
    4 supervisor creates more interactions between staff
  2 Reflection improves quality 
    1 reflection helps identify underlying values, beliefs, and assumptions and enables people to see how they can change a situation by changing the way they frame it and act on it 
    2 structured conversation protocol enable supervisor in action learning programs to see how reflection could improve their thinking and the solutions to challenges in which they were engaged


  ## Limitations
  1 Older generation perceives virtual learning community may keep them isolated and segregated in "electronic communication"

## 180924 (meta analysis, meaning making)
1. Psychosocial interventions for elderly diagnosed of Alzheimer's
1.1 Objective: compare the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions conducted for Chinese population and Western population diagnosed of Alzheimer's Disease from 2010 to 2018
1.2 Methods: 
  1.2.1 Chinese literature (CNKI, VIP, Wanfang) and English literature (Pubmed, Cochrane, Medline)
  1.2.2 Inclusion criteria: RCT, screening tools (MMSE, ADL, QOL), diagnosed by ICD or DSM, etc.
  1.2.3 Exclusion criteria: non-RCR, no comparison group, Chinese herb and medicine treatment, pharmacological intervention, comorbidity, etc.
  1.2.4 Year range: 2008-2018
1.3 Statistics:
  1.3.1 publication bias analysis
  1.3.2 Forest plot for effectiveness comparison of between group (Chinese population and foreign population) on demographics and treatment effects
  1.3.3 meta-regression: whether demographics and Western/Chinese populations have differences on their treatment effects
1.4 similar studies
  1.4.1 Meta-analysis of nonpharmacological interventions for neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. (Brodaty, et al.,2012)
  1.4.2 Meta‐analysis of psychosocial interventions for caregivers of people with dementia. (Brodaty, et al., 2003)
  1.4.3 Nonpharmacological Therapies in Alzheimer’s Disease: A Systematic Review of Efficacy (prior to 2008). (Olazarán, et al., 2010) 
1.5 Questions:
  1.5.1 Would comparing Chinese and foreign populations be a narrow topic considering to publish in an English journal?
  1.5.2 My assumption to compare two populations is that people's treatment (psychosocial intervention/medication) and residence (living at home or community/institution) preference are different. Would comparison be worth doing?
    argument: 
      By policy and by choice - no diagnosis, medication, medical care
      Settings: 
      Literature: meta-analysis and cross-country

2. Meaning-making of caregivers
2.1 Objective: Discuss meaning-making model through a meta-analysis perspective
2.2 Variables:

  2.2.3 Beliefs: beliefs about the world, beliefs about the self, beliefs about the self in the world
  2.2.4 Measurement: 
    2.2.4.1 Initial appraised meaning of stressful events [Stress Appraisal Measure (SAM)]; 
    2.2.4.2 Global and situational meaning-making (coping):

  Others:
    "Meaning-making": abstract, keywords, title; 
    methodology, empirical, factors, theory, qualitative/quantitative
    * stress processing: primary and secondary appraisal
    * theory: cultural difference in social cognition; 
    * survey/questionnaire 
    * reflective group: 
      5-6 sessions: 
      Caregiver support: burden, depression, caregiving
      reflective group course structure: 
    Team meeting:
      # factors impact
      # primary/secondary appraisal: general questions about these two parts.
      # cohorts study: aging issues; cohort effects rather than aging affects; literature preparation on maturity levels of one cohort.
2.3 Problem:
  2.3.1 Individual differences: personality, values, beliefs that cause difference in global and situational meaning and meaning-making process
  2.3.2 Research on coping strategies are overlooked: adaptive transformation of goals, changes in coping strategies as people age, 
  2.3.3 Meaning making process is intentional or unconscious?

        2. meaning making process
        3. coping strategies
    ■	keywords:

        2. Meaning making: "meaning mak*" or "mak* meaning" or "sense mak*" or "mak* sense" or "locus of control" or ...
    ■	research goal:
        1. what does meaning making means in carer population?
        2. what are their meaning making process? does it echo to Park's model?
        3. what are the coping strategies when making meaning?
        4. to validate the meaning making model

  ○	Systematic review on meaning making (and interventions for Alzheimers)
    ■	to check with Huiying and Jieling on their work in regards to systematic review
    ■	to work on as class assignments
2.	Plan for next session [could be earlier since our project is moving faster in this stage]
  ○	to report analytical methods for data mining of meaning making
  ○	to report primary preparation for systematic review on meaning making
3.	Questions:
  ○	Would you please help coordinate Dr. Luo in this data mining project? I guess we need to have a meeting on this topic, because I am not quite familiar with meaing-making even though I learned the theory and its basic construct. [my suggestion is do a literature review on meaning making & carer first; then we would have much more confidence what to “mine” in the data sea. For the technical side, no worries, I will link you to Dr. Luo]
  ○	You mentioned questionnaire related to meaning-making (I couldn't hear that part clearly due to signal issues)? Are you suggesting to design part of the questionnaires based on the result of data mining? [I mean if you could identify new framework on meaning making, or other key variables that you would like to be included for your thesis, I will support you. But time is important – the project data collection would start late this year or early next year. Again, literature review is important.]

1. Rational to select countries under review

2. Under each country - United Kingdom
  2.1.	Policy name, time of enactment, weblink, etc.
    Policy Name: Carer’s Allowance (Invalid Care Allowance until 1986)
    Time of enactment: 1976
    Weblink: https://www.gov.uk/carers-allowance
  2.2.	Rational and objective
    Carer's Allowance is a means-tested, non-contributory benefit in the United Kingdom payable to people who care for a disabled person for at least 35 hours a week. It was first established as Invalid Care Allowance in 1976, not eligible for married women until the occurrence of an unlawful sexual discrimination by the European Court in 1986 in the case of Jackie Drake.
  2.3.	Defining eligibility
    The following conditions for a carer need to be met: 1) spend at least 35 hours a week caring for a disabled person (one doesn't have to live with them or be related to them); 2) care for someone who receives the higher-rate or middle-rate care component of Disability Living Allowance, either rate of Personal Independence Payment daily living component, or any rate of Attendance Allowance; 3) do not earn more than £120 a week (after deductions); 4) are not in full-time education (or 21 hours a week or more); 5) age of 16 and above; 6) have been in England, Scotland or Wales for at least 2 of the last 3 years (this doesn’t apply if you’re a refugee or have humanitarian protection status), or normally live in England, Scotland or Wales, or you live abroad as a member of the armed forces 7) not subject to immigration control.
    Noted: elderly shall include all age groups
  2.4.	Amount
    Carer’s Allowance is worth £64.60 per week (for April 2018-19) and is usually paid every four weeks
  2.5.	Administrative procedure
    1) Contact Carer’s Allowance Unit on 0800 731 0297 (text phone: 0800 731 0317) or visit GOV.UK to download a claim form or make a claim online. Local Age UK can assist when needed.
    2) Written decision and effective date will be informed if the claim is approved. A challenge can be made if the claim is turned down.
    3) Keep the Carer’s Allowance Unit informed and updated whenever there is a change of caregiving condition, including but not limited to: a) one changes, starts or leaves job; b) one starts earning more than £120 a week; c) one stops being a carer; d) one takes a holiday or goes into hospital - even if one arranges care while away; e) the person to care for goes into hospital or takes a holiday
  2.6.	Welfare regime/GDP/etc.
    Welfare regime mainly aims toward the promotion of health, education, employment, and social security. This regime causes increase in expenditure and a bigger range of government responsibility as well as in taxation, regulation of industry, food and housing.
  2.7.	Evaluation report/debate;
    1) Expenditure and burden for government take away the awareness of citizens’ personal responsibility and result in welfare dependency with which people become lack of motivation or incentives in working and personal development.
    2) Allowance, being stringent in its condition, is provided with heavy and regular caring duties for caregivers who has to give up their own work or personal business later on. All conditions of criteria allow a small percentage of carers to receive the allowance. Only under 1% of UK population received a Carer’s Allowance in 2008.
    3) Identification of targeted carers who are eligible to receive allowance can be administratively complicated and infeasible due to its various requirement to evaluate, in which some can be difficult to assess in the real setting.
  2.8.	Anything related.

        1. Intro: people have difference reactions and responses to the same event based on their own evaluations. Appraisal of an event causes an emotion, or affetive, response. 
        2. Structural Model (Lazarus, 1991):
            2.1. Primary appraisal: 
                2.1.1 evaluates two aspects of a situation: motivational relevance (relevant or irrelevant to self), motivational congruence (congruent or incongrent with one's goals)
                2.1.2 evaluation of personal significance of a specific person-environment transaction, being influenced by people's underlying assumptions or belifs about the world
            2.2. Secondary appraisal: 
                2.2.1 evaluate one's resources and options for coping
                    coping potential: problem-focused coping or emotion-focused coping
                2.2.2 evaluation of possibilities for coping and expectations regarding outcomes, being influenced by people's global meaning systems
        3. Process Model (Smith & Kirby, 2000)
            3.1 perceptual stimuli: sensation of pain or pleasure, perception of facial expression
            3.2 associative processing: memory-based process makes quick connections and provides appraisal information associated with given stimulus
            3.3 reasoning: logical, critical thinking about the stimulus and/or situation; slower and more deliberate. 
        4. Stress/Coping Framework
            4.1 demographic info, stressors, resources -> caregiver's `response to stress
            4.2 resource being a moderator affecting stress outcome
        5C. Questions:
            5.1 How many hours per day do you perceive stress?
            5.2 How many hours per day do you have to deal with the stress by yourself?
            5.3 Do you have enough resources and capability to handle the stress?
            5.4 What is your coping strategies?
            5.5 Are those still stress to you after you adopt coping strategies?
            5.6 Do you feel better after you use your coping strategies to those stress?

0. General models

(p.42)
Culture: 
    traits, integrated configurations, constellations of symbols and meanings, symbolic templates, a web of meanings, taxonomic trees, measurable units of behavior, a collection of material artifacts, systems of knowledge, sets of values and beliefs, sets of characteristics strategies for accomplishing a desired goal
    exist as public artifacts "in the world" and cognitive constructs "in the mind" of members of a community
Models:
    provides a bridge between the empiricist concept of culture as "object" and the cognitive concept of culture as forms of knowledge. 
Cultural model:
    that can distinguish culture on the ground and culture in the mind

Mental model:
    Definition
        aka mental representations
        including personal and conventional (cognitive) models
        creative and adaptive simplifications of reality that may reduce complexity of reality
    Personal model (P): 
        human are adept at constructing idiosyncratic models of experience on the fly, as a basic meaning-making strategy
        Individual -> (mental model) -> physical environment
    Conventional model (Co): 
        reaction in circumstances, settings, and cultural conditions
        not personally made but special-purpose program in which one internalize as part of his own stock of ready-made responses
        schematized by people and socially constrained and reinforced by both positive and negative social feedback
    Cultural model (Cu): 
        the origin of conventional models
        born, transformed through endless social exchanges
        a shared model provides conventional resources to a community for meaning making   
        Individual ->[(mental model) -> social environment] -> physical environment

    Co->P: 
        individuals of each generation are inscribed of conventional model
        gain motivational force in a community
        conventional models become a personal cognitive resource for individuals
        conventional model + personal experience = personal models
        individuals may experience conflicting personal and conventional models for a given domain of experience
        
    P vs Cu:
        mental representations of cultural models internalize socially constrained experiences than idiosyncratic (P) models     
        cultural practices constrain attention and guide saliency are not open to much personal choices but are closely guided by social norms

    Instituted model vs conventional mental model
        called "templates", social institutions—conventional, patterned public forms such as greetings, calendars, cockfights, discourse genres, houses, public spaces, chants, conventional body postures, and even deliberately orchestrated aromas 
        such as rituals, carnival, dance, genres, or games
        lead a double life, as part of an external social world and as products of intentional behavior
        govern concept formation of newly socialized individuals, from which individuals construct conventional mental models
        distinction
            being different from conventional mental models and the distinction is of great theoretical importance
            when comparing instituted model and conventional mental model, members of a community under certain conditions will fail to fully internalize a cultural model because their personal experiences are incompatible with the conventional model
            mental representations or meaning construction can be different 
    
    Model vs foundational schema
        schema occurs within a set of specific cultural models 
        foundation schemas lose specific sensory reference to organize a wide diversity of particular models and underwrite the possibility of meaning construction in a variety of context.

    Actors' models and observers' models
        dealing with the relationship between culture and mind
        schools:
            structuralism (Levi-Strauss)
            symbolic anthropology (Geetz, Turner, and Schneider)
            ethnoscience (Frake, Goodenough, Sturdevant, Lounesbury, and Conklin)
        models
            actors': employ symbolic forms that are dynamic and graded, permitting the representation of an individual's changing relationships to any phenomenon. They are dynamic ecological models that govern the negotiation of a changing landscape.
            observer's: adapted for the representation and social coordination of abstract general perspectives. Thus observers' models tend to be organized more in terms of categories, permitting mutual rather than just personal orientation.
        
    Model Genres
        linguistic models:
            Scripts: (conventional model) standardized conversation templates for organizing interactions in well-defined, goal-oriented situations
            Propositional models: (cultural models) prepositional symbolic forms are characterized by discursiveness. discursive symbolisms as ordinary language or mathematics have a high degree of abstractness from which they derive their power to re-present experience rather than iconically modeling it
            Sound symbolic models: (conventional model) convey important information through conventional phonological patterns, in which pronunciation styles that index different contexts in a language.
            Lexical models: model forms of experience (taxonomies) with list of names, linked items, dictionaries, and clearly defined subsets of vocabularies
            Grammatical models: highly abstract models of time, space, movement, and causality that are encoded by grammatical forms such as noun classes, verb aspect, tense structures, and agent markers. 
            Verbal formulas: encode traditional wisdom, specialized knowledge, or techniques in highly conventional forms of speech
            Narrative model: (cultural model) a uniquely ambiguous status among verbal formulas; 
            Trope models: (cultural models) important linguistic models that permit language to transcend literal reference, including metaphor models, methonym models
        Nonlinguistic models:
            Image schemas: (cultural model) "image schematic models" (Lakoff, 1987a:118) and defines them as "schematic images, such as trajectories or long, thin shapes, or containers"; related to somatic experience and knowledge; or called kinesthetic schemas convey important cultural information about status, mood, and relationship.          
            Action sets: (gestural models) Simple, stylized body movements can become integrated into a coordinated interchange  
            Olfactory models: (cultural model) Because of their special relation to long-term memory, olfactory models are often used to mark special occasions, individuals, or relationships
            Sound image models: (cultural model) Many rituals use sounds as an important component
            Visual image models: (cultural model) culturally salient paintings and decorative motifs and color symbolism
    Functional distinction among models 
        Orientational models: orienting individuals to one another and to behavioral environment
            Spatial models
                Area maps of all kinds of geographic entities
                Navigational models such as Micronesian star charts (Hutchins, 1991); verbal formats for giving traveling directions
                Route maps realized in prepositional form, pictorial form, or (as is common among Australian aborigines) in song lyrics
                Models of interpersonal space, which code for aspects of power and intimacy                
                Context markers, which frame spaces as distinctive behavioral contexts (sports fields, play frames, and performance frames are all examples of spatial context markers)
            Temporal models
                Incremental models: time related progression
                Decremental models: time count-down
                Cyclical models: various spans of time as cycles
                Rhythmic models break up the flow of time into rhythmic segments for the purpose of framing musical or verbal expression
                Biographical models are conventional models for conceptualizing people's life cycles.
                Context-framing devices mark off special time frames in the same sense as spatial models frame places
            Social orientation models
                Social relation Model: lexical models mapping kin terminologies
                Social coordination: rituals, highly scripted and formalized action sets providing a shared behavioral framework for coordinating social relations
                Social role sets model the division of labor
                Emotion models: stress the orienting and communicative function
            Diagnostic models: conventional indexical models that diagnose signs of underlying states, causes, or conditions
                Medical diagnostic models: include taxonomies and divination rites as well as metonymic and metaphoric models that read somatic symptoms in relation to classifications of disease types.
                Checklists models: taking inventory of complex procedures or collections of objects or people.
                Divinatory models: strategies for uncovering hidden causes for a community's problems.
                Meteorological models: by which communities read the state of the natural world, including weather forecasting but also models for interpreting the relationships between natural events (seasons, floods, eclipses, volcanoes, storms, tides, etc.) and their social, moral and supernatural correlates.
                Intention displays are cultural models by which members of a community read each others' intentions.
        Expressive/conceptual models: share personal experience objectified, conventionalized, and transformed into cultural artifacts
            Classificatory models: based on well-formed categories, defined in terms of the intersection of more primitive semantic components or attributes.
            Ludic models: discrete performative frame, key cultural problematics
            Ritual and dramatic models: ritual and drama are important ways that communities externalize and objectify otherwise inchoate or inarticulate experiences
            Theories: provide communities with a conceptual picture of a complex state of affairs.
        Task models
            Scripts: include both verbal and nonverbal dimensions
            Recipes: conventional task models for performing complex routines
            Checklists: standardized inventories of functionally related objects or persons
            Mnemonic models: promote the memorability of important and frequently used information.
            Persuasion models: Persuasion models include a wide variety of specific conventions like prayer, sacrifice, begging, debate, sorcery, love magic, rational argument, sympathetic or contagious magic, apology, commands, and promising

subjective aging - negative views of aging, age identity
awareness of age-related change (AARC)
  perception of the positive and negative age-related changes in their physical and psychological functioning and tries to explain what makes people aware of their age and aging in several domains of life (e.g., health, lifestyle, interpersonal relationships)
  negative perception ~ lower wellbeing ~ poorer health behavior and social integration ~ lower self-esteem, ~ lower optimism ~ lower self-Efficacy
  intergenerational (inter-group) interaction (contact) for perception changes
    volunteer organizations being younger and older people together to word on a shared tasks
    preschool and school-aged children visiting retirement communities,
    retired older adults sharing their experience with and mentoring children in schools

# Perception of aging -> Changing ecologies of aging (p.211)
Micro system: individual's interactions within an environment (the workplace, the health care system)
  work place
    person characteristics: 
      workplace success
      opportunities for workplace engagement
      decision about retirement
      work experience <-> perception of aging process + sense of productivity and responsibility
    environment characteristics: 
      poor performance and productivity (slower sped, poorer memory, less turnover)
      inflexible, resistant to change, uninterested or unable to learn new technologies
      discrimination, loss of historical company knowledge, missed opportunities for productivity
  Health Care System
    person characteristics
      physical health: cardiovascular disease, including heightened physiological stress response, poorer recovery from heart attack, and higher likelihood of experiencing a cardiac event, impaired sensory functioning
      mental health (major depressive symptoms) <-> perception of age + age versus subjective age 
    environment characteristics 
      quality and amount of care provided to elderly: poorer quality of patient–physician communication, decreased provision of medical information and counseling, failure to recommend certain medical procedures, and limited access to participation in clinical trials, which significantly limits the evidence available for many drugs regularly prescribed to older adults
      health provider's attitude
      competence or functional ability: physical health, sensory functioning, independence, language skills, and social and emotional development.
      subjective factors (such as disengagement from the world, loss of interest in living, unproductivity, and inflexibility
  other example: self-directed attitudes about aging held by an individual, including how satisfied the person is with his or her own aging process, the awareness of becoming older, and the age with which the person identifies are shaped by ongoing interactions(called proximal processes) of the aging individual with the immediate environment.

Meso system:
  subjective aging is negotiated through interactions between two or more microsystems.
  e.g.: Encounters between the staff and family members of a resident at a long-term care facility might have strong influence on subjectively perceived opportunities and developmental constraints of an older person, which in turn affect his or her views of the aging process.

Exo system:
  captures the indirect influence and interaction of two or more remote settings, at least one of which that does not directly involve the individual.
  e.g.: the influences of a physician’s medical training on the individual or the influence of a family caregiver’s connection (or lack of connection) to local caregiving resources and information on an aging parent.

Macro system: reflects those patterns made up by the micro-, meso-, and exosystems.
  current societal structures of aging
    people retired from their primary profession and career but do not feel old at all and indeed start new life projects in areas such as partnership, intergenerational engagement, volunteering, housing, or leisure (James & Wink, 2006).
    the fourth age (85+) has been characterized as vulnerable and high risk of multiple losses
  indications of changing (social) images of aging
    historical physical decline
    social roles
    elderly in an aging society may fuel aging anxiety, fears, or disease-specific concerns such as dementia worries
    socioeconomic position and health
  persisting societal age norms 
    fixed retirement age and extended health condition and life span generate a new life phases
    nationally held attitudes and norms are important for shaping how older workers are perceived
    Formal and informal age norms are often intended to protect society or the older person from harm caused by declining abilities and diminishing opportunities.
    This structural lag between the need and competencies of an individual and the opportunities provided by society might reinforce loss-oriented experiences of aging and, in turn, limit access to meaningful roles which could provide individuals with the opportunity to have experiences of mastery and competence.
  other example: the macrosystem encompasses the broad age stereotypes and values assigned to “being old,” which are unconsciously adopted and widely held by members of a particular culture (sociocultural perspective on age stereotypes; Hummert, 2011), and also includes cultural structures and social policies.

Interventions at micro and macro levels
  people (micro)
    intervention recipient: 
      higher tendencies toward neuroticism (Moor, Zimprich,Schmitt, & Kliegel, 2006), 
      living in socioeconomically disadvantaged conditions (Barrett, 2003), 
      a higher number of television viewing hours (Donlon, Ashman, & Levy, 2005), and 
      a family history of Alzheimer’s disease (Suhr & Kinkela, 2007).
    health provider
      frequently work with the sickest older adults are limited in the opportunities interacting with healthy older adults and are therefore at risk of developing more negative views on aging (Meisner, 2012).
  intervention strategies (micro)
    a program supporting one to successfully complete a meaningful tasks -(reinforcement)> improved views on aging
    education to health providers may change attitude toward older patient (Samra et al., 2013)
    intervention including experiential components such as simulations and activities designed to promote empathy, may change attitude of participating medical professionals
    Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) determines which intervention components offer the greatest potential benefit to participants
  Research (micro)
    Stereotype embodiment theory: psychological, behavioral, and physiological (Levy, 2009)
      explains how subjective aging influences physical health, so does workplace performance..improve, after an intervention which helps individuals become aware of age stereotypes and change their expectations, age attributions, self-efficacy, or control beliefs.
      interventions designed for individuals and professionals should target key psychological, behavioral, and physiological pathways by which negative self-views and age stereotypes influence health and wellbeing. 
    self-regulation strategies (e.g., selection, optimization, and compensation): 
    the process of misattributing symptoms of illness or disability as signs of pathological aging as opposed to normal aging has detrimental consequences for physical health. intervention efforts that target expectancies and attributions of aging is effective for promoting positive health
      1) adults aged 80 years and older who attributed a chronic health condition to old age tended to report more bothersome symptoms, engaged in fewer health behaviors, and were also twice as likely to have died by the 2-year follow-up (Stewart, Chipperfield, Perry, & Weiner, 2012).
      2) adults who attributed symptoms of arthritis, heart disease, and sleeping problems to normal aging rather than chronic disease were significantly less likely to have sought preventive medical services in the previous year (Goodwin, Black, & Satish, 1999).
  Role of social policy and health care policy (macro)
    virtues and the risks of the aging process and societal aging: take advantage of the developmental plasticity of elderly and to encourage individuals to recognize and seize opportunities for growth and development in the later phase of life span
    aging is a dynamic developmental process in which one should be responsible for their changes and improvement
    dissociate aging and disease in individual and societal conceptions of aging process
    social policies regarding retirement age disentangle aging from disease; whereas retirement policy assumes one's functional performance goes down as getting older
  Role of mass media (macro)
    social and health care policies, the mass media and the internet play an important role in conveying societal views on aging and post portrays of older adults in the media 
    older adults with greater tv exposure without appropriate interventions hold more negative views on aging
  Research (macro)
    societal age stereotypes are internalized in the young generation throughout their life span
    socioeconomic strata differences provide opportunities and constraints for positive views on aging
    systematic review of subjective aging that investigates changes in views on aging across historical periods
    positive and negative views on aging influence on developmental outcomes
    balanced between positive and negative views on aging predicts one's limits and potentials in terms of successful aging
    subgroups of aging population: lower socioeconomic strata or racial or ethnic minority groups
    interplay between societal age norms and subjective aging on the microlevel will be to examine the subjective aging experiences among individuals in various stages of retirement (e.g., planning for, entering, and living in retirement as well as reentering the workforce).


Structure lag (Riley & Riley, 1994)
  inability of society to keep up with rapid biological and life span changes (extended)
  related to micro and macro levels
  individuals living in those "extended years" do not engage in matched meaningful and productive work recognized or values by society. individuals are less likely to use adaptive self-regulation strategies if they hold negative self-perceptions of aging, thereby experiencing poorer health outcomes (Wurm, Warner, Ziegelmann, Wolff, & Schuz, 2013).

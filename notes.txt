### 180924 on meta analysis

1. Psychosocial interventions for elderly diagnosed of Alzheimer's
1.1 Objective: compare the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions conducted for Chinese population and Western population diagnosed of Alzheimer's Disease from 2010 to 2018
1.2 Methods: 
    1.2.1 Chinese literature (CNKI, VIP, Wanfang) and English literature (Pubmed, Cochrane, Medline)
    1.2.2 Inclusion criteria: RCT, screening tools (MMSE, ADL, QOL), diagnosed by ICD or DSM, etc.
    1.2.3 Exclusion criteria: non-RCR, no comparison group, Chinese herb and medicine treatment, pharmacological intervention, comorbidity, etc.
    1.2.4 Year range: 2008-2018
1.3 Statistics:
    1.3.1 publication bias analysis
    1.3.2 Forest plot for effectiveness comparison of between group (Chinese population and foreign population) on demographics and treatment effects
    1.3.3 meta-regression: whether demographics and Western/Chinese populations have differences on their treatment effects
1.4 similar studies
    1.4.1 Meta-analysis of nonpharmacological interventions for neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. (Brodaty, et al.,2012)
    1.4.2 Meta‐analysis of psychosocial interventions for caregivers of people with dementia. (Brodaty, et al., 2003)
    1.4.3 Nonpharmacological Therapies in Alzheimer’s Disease: A Systematic Review of Efficacy (prior to 2008). (Olazarán, et al., 2010) 
1.5 Questions:
    1.5.1 Would comparing Chinese and foreign populations be a narrow topic considering to publish in an English journal?
    1.5.2 My assumption to compare two populations is that people's treatment (psychosocial intervention/medication) and residence (living at home or community/institution) preference are different. Would comparison be worth doing?

argument: 
    By policy and by choice - no diagnosis, medication, medical care
    Settings: 
    Literature: meta-analysis and cross-country

Caregiving allowance ~ women (gender study) incentive for formal care; economic values performed, reduced labor market participation, structure of labor market, caregiving (formal or informal) for elderly (disabled or general) is effective

Meaning Making Model:

System Theory (Caregiving model * Generational Model * Meaning Making Model) - Long-term care system: 
1.	Carer:
    i.	Psychological distress
        1.	Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI)
    ii.	Meaning-making (the restoration of meaning in the context of highly stressful situations)
        1.	There is increasing consensus that meaning making (i.e., “the restoration of meaning in the context of highly stressful situations;” Park, 2010, p. 257) can represent a central aspect of coping and adjustment in these contexts. From a meaning making perspective, challenges emerge if the reality of a stressor cannot be adaptively assimilated into global meaning (e.g., preexisting beliefs/values, goals) and/or the person cannot accommodate aspects of their global system to situationally construct meaning out of the experience (Holland, 2015). These violations of meaning can be quite distressing and lead to strained efforts to reconcile one’s appraisal of the stressor and global meaning, which may manifest as MDD or other mental health problems that prompt individuals to seek psychotherapy (Kendler, Karkowski, & Prescott, 1999; Park 2010).
        2.	Help clients (carers) make sense of significant stressors and regain a sense of purpose and direction in life (Clark, 1995).
        3.	Meaning made [Chinese version of the Positive Aspects of Caregiving (PAC)]: Affirming self, Enriching life 
        4.	Meaning search: situational meaning [Finding Meaning Through Caregiving Scale (FMTCS) – loss/powerfulness + provisional meaning], global meaning (self-in-world, life goals, sense of life purpose)
2.	Family: social assistance-like arrangement: residential care, home care
    i.	caregiving intensity
    ii.	caregiving needs [Activity of Daily Living (ADL)]
    iii.	physical health
    iv.	mental health
    v.	part/full-time work
    vi.	income, income security, social security 
    vii.	gender, age, marital status, education level, living arrangement, financial status, physical distance (co-resident caregivers), 
3.	Government: 
    i.	Tasks: cost management, program evaluation, administered means-tested assisting program 
    ii.	Policies: health, social, employment policies 
4.	Market: economic values of output by government and input by care recipients and carers; caregiving evaluated in terms of changes in aging and social values;  impact of care allowance on the labor force participation of women caregivers; community care rather than institutionalization is financially more cost-effective (economically and quality-wised); 
5.	Voluntary sectors: volunteers, organizations, community care, NGO, NPO; charitable or religious organizations; 
6.	Social workers 
    i.	reflective groups
7.	Social background: social cost, social pressures, social insurance system, policy beneficiary to female; 

Generations [baby boomer: 1946-1964; generation X: 1965-1980]
    1.	Sense of loss, self centered; Tendency of searching meaning; Sense of meaning made 
    2.	Well-being ~ Sense of loss + meaning searching

Interactions, Meaning-making Model:
    1.	Examine distribution for responsibilities of long-term care between the state, the market, and the family
    2.	Factors for participating in paid labor market and informal caregiving
    3.	Caregiving intensity 

Effects:
    1.	Substitution effect: time needs for informal care work reduces labor market participation
    2.	Income effect: high cost of caregiving induce carers to increase labor market participation to earn more income
    3.	Demand for respite work: work as respite to avoid heavy caring work and mental pressure
    4.	Disadvantage in job market due to high rate of absenteeism

Problems:
    1.	Opportunity costs of caregivers’ foregone earnings and leisure
    2.	Expenditure in household
    3.	Health effects and impact on marriages
    4.	Reduction of work hours

Caregiving relationship 
    1.	Care recipient and informal caregiver:

1.	Discussion
    ○	Country review of the United States and Japan 
        ■	looking into literature 
        ■	to finish next Monday
    ○	Data mining (web scraping with Python) on social media on meaning-making
        ■	reading two books: Mastering Social Media Mining with Python (Bonzanini), Python Social Media Analytics (Chatterjee & Krystyanczuk)
        ■	to find the application for the analysis of meaning-making
        ■	association of "meaning making" or "meaning searching" with people's understanding, definition, and attitude while recording demographic info of carers through social media (websites, blogs, forum, social networking platform such as fb and twitter, pinterest, youtube), or,
        ■	evaluate feedbacks and responses from carers to a list of meaning-making-related topics
        ■	to contact Dr. Luo Hao on programming and coding issues
    ○	Systematic review on meaning making (and interventions for Alzheimers)
        ■	to check with Huiying and Jieling on their work in regards to systematic review
        ■	to work on as class assignments
2.	Plan for next session [could be earlier since our project is moving faster in this stage]
    ○	to report analytical methods for data mining of meaning making
    ○	to report primary preparation for systematic review on meaning making
3.	Questions:
    ○	Would you please help coordinate Dr. Luo in this data mining project? I guess we need to have a meeting on this topic, because I am not quite familiar with meaing-making even though I learned the theory and its basic construct. [my suggestion is do a literature review on meaning making & carer first; then we would have much more confidence what to “mine” in the data sea. For the technical side, no worries, I will link you to Dr. Luo]
    ○	You mentioned questionnaire related to meaning-making (I couldn't hear that part clearly due to signal issues)? Are you suggesting to design part of the questionnaires based on the result of data mining? [I mean if you could identify new framework on meaning making, or other key variables that you would like to be included for your thesis, I will support you. But time is important – the project data collection would start late this year or early next year. Again, literature review is important.]

### 180906  #########################################################


1.   	Rational to select countries under review

2.   	Under each country - United Kingdom
    2.1.	Policy name, time of enactment, weblink, etc.
        Policy Name: Carer’s Allowance (Invalid Care Allowance until 1986)
        Time of enactment: 1976
        Weblink: https://www.gov.uk/carers-allowance
    2.2.	Rational and objective
        Carer's Allowance is a means-tested, non-contributory benefit in the United Kingdom payable to people who care for a disabled person for at least 35 hours a week. It was first established as Invalid Care Allowance in 1976, not eligible for married women until the occurrence of an unlawful sexual discrimination by the European Court in 1986 in the case of Jackie Drake.
    2.3.	Defining eligibility
        The following conditions for a carer need to be met: 1) spend at least 35 hours a week caring for a disabled person (one doesn't have to live with them or be related to them); 2) care for someone who receives the higher-rate or middle-rate care component of Disability Living Allowance, either rate of Personal Independence Payment daily living component, or any rate of Attendance Allowance; 3) do not earn more than £120 a week (after deductions); 4) are not in full-time education (or 21 hours a week or more); 5) age of 16 and above; 6) have been in England, Scotland or Wales for at least 2 of the last 3 years (this doesn’t apply if you’re a refugee or have humanitarian protection status), or normally live in England, Scotland or Wales, or you live abroad as a member of the armed forces 7) not subject to immigration control.
        Noted: elderly shall include all age groups
    2.4.	Amount
        Carer’s Allowance is worth £64.60 per week (for April 2018-19) and is usually paid every four weeks
    2.5.	Administrative procedure
        1) Contact Carer’s Allowance Unit on 0800 731 0297 (text phone: 0800 731 0317) or visit GOV.UK to download a claim form or make a claim online. Local Age UK can assist when needed.
        2) Written decision and effective date will be informed if the claim is approved. A challenge can be made if the claim is turned down.
        3) Keep the Carer’s Allowance Unit informed and updated whenever there is a change of caregiving condition, including but not limited to: a) one changes, starts or leaves job; b) one starts earning more than £120 a week; c) one stops being a carer; d) one takes a holiday or goes into hospital - even if one arranges care while away; e) the person to care for goes into hospital or takes a holiday
    2.6.	Welfare regime/GDP/etc.
        Welfare regime mainly aims toward the promotion of health, education, employment, and social security. This regime causes increase in expenditure and a bigger range of government responsibility as well as in taxation, regulation of industry, food and housing.
    2.7.	Evaluation report/debate;
        1) Expenditure and burden for government take away the awareness of citizens’ personal responsibility and result in welfare dependency with which people become lack of motivation or incentives in working and personal development.
        2) Allowance, being stringent in its condition, is provided with heavy and regular caring duties for caregivers who has to give up their own work or personal business later on. All conditions of criteria allow a small percentage of carers to receive the allowance. Only under 1% of UK population received a Carer’s Allowance in 2008.
        3) Identification of targeted carers who are eligible to receive allowance can be administratively complicated and infeasible due to its various requirement to evaluate, in which some can be difficult to assess in the real setting.
    2.8.	Anything related.

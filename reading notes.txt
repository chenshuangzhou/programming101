0. General models

(p.42)
Culture: 
    traits, integrated configurations, constellations of symbols and meanings, symbolic templates, a web of meanings, taxonomic trees, measurable units of behavior, a collection of material artifacts, systems of knowledge, sets of values and beliefs, sets of characteristics strategies for accomplishing a desired goal
    exist as public artifacts "in the world" and cognitive constructs "in the mind" of members of a community
Models:
    provides a bridge between the empiricist concept of culture as "object" and the cognitive concept of culture as forms of knowledge. 
Cultural model:
    that can distinguish culture on the ground and culture in the mind

Mental model:
    Definition
        aka mental representations
        including personal and conventional (cognitive) models
        creative and adaptive simplifications of reality that may reduce complexity of reality
    Personal model (P): 
        human are adept at constructing idiosyncratic models of experience on the fly, as a basic meaning-making strategy
        Individual -> (mental model) -> physical environment
    Conventional model (Co): 
        reaction in circumstances, settings, and cultural conditions
        not personally made but special-purpose program in which one internalize as part of his own stock of ready-made responses
        schematized by people and socially constrained and reinforced by both positive and negative social feedback
    Cultural model (Cu): 
        the origin of conventional models
        born, transformed through endless social exchanges
        a shared model provides conventional resources to a community for meaning making   
        Individual ->[(mental model) -> social environment] -> physical environment

    Co->P: 
        individuals of each generation are inscribed of conventional model
        gain motivational force in a community
        conventional models become a personal cognitive resource for individuals
        conventional model + personal experience = personal models
        individuals may experience conflicting personal and conventional models for a given domain of experience
        
    P vs Cu:
        mental representations of cultural models internalize socially constrained experiences than idiosyncratic (P) models     
        cultural practices constrain attention and guide saliency are not open to much personal choices but are closely guided by social norms

    Instituted model vs conventional mental model
        called "templates", social institutions—conventional, patterned public forms such as greetings, calendars, cockfights, discourse genres, houses, public spaces, chants, conventional body postures, and even deliberately orchestrated aromas 
        such as rituals, carnival, dance, genres, or games
        lead a double life, as part of an external social world and as products of intentional behavior
        govern concept formation of newly socialized individuals, from which individuals construct conventional mental models
        distinction
            being different from conventional mental models and the distinction is of great theoretical importance
            when comparing instituted model and conventional mental model, members of a community under certain conditions will fail to fully internalize a cultural model because their personal experiences are incompatible with the conventional model
            mental representations or meaning construction can be different 
    
    Model vs foundational schema
        schema occurs within a set of specific cultural models 
        foundation schemas lose specific sensory reference to organize a wide diversity of particular models and underwrite the possibility of meaning construction in a variety of context.

    Actors' models and observers' models
        dealing with the relationship between culture and mind
        schools:
            structuralism (Levi-Strauss)
            symbolic anthropology (Geetz, Turner, and Schneider)
            ethnoscience (Frake, Goodenough, Sturdevant, Lounesbury, and Conklin)
        models
            actors': employ symbolic forms that are dynamic and graded, permitting the representation of an individual's changing relationships to any phenomenon. They are dynamic ecological models that govern the negotiation of a changing landscape.
            observer's: adapted for the representation and social coordination of abstract general perspectives. Thus observers' models tend to be organized more in terms of categories, permitting mutual rather than just personal orientation.
        
    Model Genres
        linguistic models:
            Scripts: (conventional model) standardized conversation templates for organizing interactions in well-defined, goal-oriented situations
            Propositional models: (cultural models) prepositional symbolic forms are characterized by discursiveness. discursive symbolisms as ordinary language or mathematics have a high degree of abstractness from which they derive their power to re-present experience rather than iconically modeling it
            Sound symbolic models: (conventional model) convey important information through conventional phonological patterns, in which pronunciation styles that index different contexts in a language.
            Lexical models: model forms of experience (taxonomies) with list of names, linked items, dictionaries, and clearly defined subsets of vocabularies
            Grammatical models: highly abstract models of time, space, movement, and causality that are encoded by grammatical forms such as noun classes, verb aspect, tense structures, and agent markers. 
            Verbal formulas: encode traditional wisdom, specialized knowledge, or techniques in highly conventional forms of speech
            Narrative model: (cultural model) a uniquely ambiguous status among verbal formulas; 
            Trope models: (cultural models) important linguistic models that permit language to transcend literal reference, including metaphor models, methonym models
        Nonlinguistic models:
            Image schemas: (cultural model) "image schematic models" (Lakoff, 1987a:118) and defines them as "schematic images, such as trajectories or long, thin shapes, or containers"; related to somatic experience and knowledge; or called kinesthetic schemas convey important cultural information about status, mood, and relationship.          
            Action sets: (gestural models) Simple, stylized body movements can become integrated into a coordinated interchange  
            Olfactory models: (cultural model) Because of their special relation to long-term memory, olfactory models are often used to mark special occasions, individuals, or relationships
            Sound image models: (cultural model) Many rituals use sounds as an important component
            Visual image models: (cultural model) culturally salient paintings and decorative motifs and color symbolism
    Functional distinction among models 
        Orientational models: orienting individuals to one another and to behavioral environment
            Spatial models
                Area maps of all kinds of geographic entities
                Navigational models such as Micronesian star charts (Hutchins, 1991); verbal formats for giving traveling directions
                Route maps realized in prepositional form, pictorial form, or (as is common among Australian aborigines) in song lyrics
                Models of interpersonal space, which code for aspects of power and intimacy                
                Context markers, which frame spaces as distinctive behavioral contexts (sports fields, play frames, and performance frames are all examples of spatial context markers)
            Temporal models
                Incremental models: time related progression
                Decremental models: time count-down
                Cyclical models: various spans of time as cycles
                Rhythmic models break up the flow of time into rhythmic segments for the purpose of framing musical or verbal expression
                Biographical models are conventional models for conceptualizing people's life cycles.
                Context-framing devices mark off special time frames in the same sense as spatial models frame places
            Social orientation models
                Social relation Model: lexical models mapping kin terminologies
                Social coordination: rituals, highly scripted and formalized action sets providing a shared behavioral framework for coordinating social relations
                Social role sets model the division of labor
                Emotion models: stress the orienting and communicative function
            Diagnostic models: conventional indexical models that diagnose signs of underlying states, causes, or conditions
                Medical diagnostic models: include taxonomies and divination rites as well as metonymic and metaphoric models that read somatic symptoms in relation to classifications of disease types.
                Checklists models: taking inventory of complex procedures or collections of objects or people.
                Divinatory models: strategies for uncovering hidden causes for a community's problems.
                Meteorological models: by which communities read the state of the natural world, including weather forecasting but also models for interpreting the relationships between natural events (seasons, floods, eclipses, volcanoes, storms, tides, etc.) and their social, moral and supernatural correlates.
                Intention displays are cultural models by which members of a community read each others' intentions.
        Expressive/conceptual models: share personal experience objectified, conventionalized, and transformed into cultural artifacts
            Classificatory models: based on well-formed categories, defined in terms of the intersection of more primitive semantic components or attributes.
            Ludic models: discrete performative frame, key cultural problematics
            Ritual and dramatic models: ritual and drama are important ways that communities externalize and objectify otherwise inchoate or inarticulate experiences
            Theories: provide communities with a conceptual picture of a complex state of affairs.
        Task models
            Scripts: include both verbal and nonverbal dimensions
            Recipes: conventional task models for performing complex routines
            Checklists: standardized inventories of functionally related objects or persons
            Mnemonic models: promote the memorability of important and frequently used information.
            Persuasion models: Persuasion models include a wide variety of specific conventions like prayer, sacrifice, begging, debate, sorcery, love magic, rational argument, sympathetic or contagious magic, apology, commands, and promising

### [Subjective Aging in annual review of gerontology and geriatrics， 2015]
subjective aging - negative views of aging, age identity
awareness of age-related change (AARC)
  perception of the positive and negative age-related changes in their physical and psychological functioning and tries to explain what makes people aware of their age and aging in several domains of life (e.g., health, lifestyle, interpersonal relationships)
  negative perception ~ lower wellbeing ~ poorer health behavior and social integration ~ lower self-esteem, ~ lower optimism ~ lower self-Efficacy
  intergenerational (inter-group) interaction (contact) for perception changes
    volunteer organizations being younger and older people together to word on a shared tasks
    preschool and school-aged children visiting retirement communities,
    retired older adults sharing their experience with and mentoring children in schools
  challenges on changing negative perception of aging
    change age identity and its causing factors
    strategies to promote positive perception of aging
    stability and the long-term maintenance of effects

# Perception of aging -> Changing ecologies of aging (p.211)
Micro system: individual's interactions within an environment (the workplace, the health care system)
  work place
    person characteristics: 
      workplace success
      opportunities for workplace engagement
      decision about retirement
      work experience <-> perception of aging process + sense of productivity and responsibility
    environment characteristics: 
      poor performance and productivity (slower sped, poorer memory, less turnover)
      inflexible, resistant to change, uninterested or unable to learn new technologies
      discrimination, loss of historical company knowledge, missed opportunities for productivity
  Health Care System
    person characteristics
      physical health: cardiovascular disease, including heightened physiological stress response, poorer recovery from heart attack, and higher likelihood of experiencing a cardiac event, impaired sensory functioning
      mental health (major depressive symptoms) <-> perception of age + age versus subjective age 
    environment characteristics 
      quality and amount of care provided to elderly: poorer quality of patient–physician communication, decreased provision of medical information and counseling, failure to recommend certain medical procedures, and limited access to participation in clinical trials, which significantly limits the evidence available for many drugs regularly prescribed to older adults
      health provider's attitude
      competence or functional ability: physical health, sensory functioning, independence, language skills, and social and emotional development.
      subjective factors (such as disengagement from the world, loss of interest in living, unproductivity, and inflexibility
  other example: self-directed attitudes about aging held by an individual, including how satisfied the person is with his or her own aging process, the awareness of becoming older, and the age with which the person identifies are shaped by ongoing interactions(called proximal processes) of the aging individual with the immediate environment.

Meso system:
  subjective aging is negotiated through interactions between two or more microsystems.
  e.g.: Encounters between the staff and family members of a resident at a long-term care facility might have strong influence on subjectively perceived opportunities and developmental constraints of an older person, which in turn affect his or her views of the aging process.

Exo system:
  captures the indirect influence and interaction of two or more remote settings, at least one of which that does not directly involve the individual.
  e.g.: the influences of a physician’s medical training on the individual or the influence of a family caregiver’s connection (or lack of connection) to local caregiving resources and information on an aging parent.

Macro system: reflects those patterns made up by the micro-, meso-, and exosystems.
  current societal structures of aging
    people retired from their primary profession and career but do not feel old at all and indeed start new life projects in areas such as partnership, intergenerational engagement, volunteering, housing, or leisure (James & Wink, 2006).
    the fourth age (85+) has been characterized as vulnerable and high risk of multiple losses
  indications of changing (social) images of aging
    historical physical decline
    social roles
    elderly in an aging society may fuel aging anxiety, fears, or disease-specific concerns such as dementia worries
    socioeconomic position and health
  persisting societal age norms 
    fixed retirement age and extended health condition and life span generate a new life phases
    nationally held attitudes and norms are important for shaping how older workers are perceived
    Formal and informal age norms are often intended to protect society or the older person from harm caused by declining abilities and diminishing opportunities.
    This structural lag between the need and competencies of an individual and the opportunities provided by society might reinforce loss-oriented experiences of aging and, in turn, limit access to meaningful roles which could provide individuals with the opportunity to have experiences of mastery and competence.
  other example: the macrosystem encompasses the broad age stereotypes and values assigned to “being old,” which are unconsciously adopted and widely held by members of a particular culture (sociocultural perspective on age stereotypes; Hummert, 2011), and also includes cultural structures and social policies.

Interventions at micro and macro levels
  people (micro)
    intervention recipient: 
      higher tendencies toward neuroticism (Moor, Zimprich,Schmitt, & Kliegel, 2006), 
      living in socioeconomically disadvantaged conditions (Barrett, 2003), 
      a higher number of television viewing hours (Donlon, Ashman, & Levy, 2005), and 
      a family history of Alzheimer’s disease (Suhr & Kinkela, 2007).
    health provider
      frequently work with the sickest older adults are limited in the opportunities interacting with healthy older adults and are therefore at risk of developing more negative views on aging (Meisner, 2012).
  intervention strategies (micro)
    a program supporting one to successfully complete a meaningful tasks -(reinforcement)> improved views on aging
    education to health providers may change attitude toward older patient (Samra et al., 2013)
    intervention including experiential components such as simulations and activities designed to promote empathy, may change attitude of participating medical professionals
    Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) determines which intervention components offer the greatest potential benefit to participants
  Research (micro)
    Stereotype embodiment theory: psychological, behavioral, and physiological (Levy, 2009)
      explains how subjective aging influences physical health, so does workplace performance..improve, after an intervention which helps individuals become aware of age stereotypes and change their expectations, age attributions, self-efficacy, or control beliefs.
      interventions designed for individuals and professionals should target key psychological, behavioral, and physiological pathways by which negative self-views and age stereotypes influence health and wellbeing. 
    self-regulation strategies (e.g., selection, optimization, and compensation): 
    the process of misattributing symptoms of illness or disability as signs of pathological aging as opposed to normal aging has detrimental consequences for physical health. intervention efforts that target expectancies and attributions of aging is effective for promoting positive health
      1) adults aged 80 years and older who attributed a chronic health condition to old age tended to report more bothersome symptoms, engaged in fewer health behaviors, and were also twice as likely to have died by the 2-year follow-up (Stewart, Chipperfield, Perry, & Weiner, 2012).
      2) adults who attributed symptoms of arthritis, heart disease, and sleeping problems to normal aging rather than chronic disease were significantly less likely to have sought preventive medical services in the previous year (Goodwin, Black, & Satish, 1999).
  Role of social policy and health care policy (macro)
    virtues and the risks of the aging process and societal aging: take advantage of the developmental plasticity of elderly and to encourage individuals to recognize and seize opportunities for growth and development in the later phase of life span
    aging is a dynamic developmental process in which one should be responsible for their changes and improvement
    dissociate aging and disease in individual and societal conceptions of aging process
    social policies regarding retirement age disentangle aging from disease; whereas retirement policy assumes one's functional performance goes down as getting older
  Role of mass media (macro)
    social and health care policies, the mass media and the internet play an important role in conveying societal views on aging and post portrays of older adults in the media 
    older adults with greater tv exposure without appropriate interventions hold more negative views on aging
  Research (macro)
    societal age stereotypes are internalized in the young generation throughout their life span
    socioeconomic strata differences provide opportunities and constraints for positive views on aging
    systematic review of subjective aging that investigates changes in views on aging across historical periods
    positive and negative views on aging influence on developmental outcomes
    balanced between positive and negative views on aging predicts one's limits and potentials in terms of successful aging
    subgroups of aging population: lower socioeconomic strata or racial or ethnic minority groups
    interplay between societal age norms and subjective aging on the microlevel will be to examine the subjective aging experiences among individuals in various stages of retirement (e.g., planning for, entering, and living in retirement as well as reentering the workforce).


Structure lag (Riley & Riley, 1994)
  inability of society to keep up with rapid biological and life span changes (extended)
  related to micro and macro levels
  individuals living in those "extended years" do not engage in matched meaningful and productive work recognized or values by society. individuals are less likely to use adaptive self-regulation strategies if they hold negative self-perceptions of aging, thereby experiencing poorer health outcomes (Wurm, Warner, Ziegelmann, Wolff, & Schuz, 2013).

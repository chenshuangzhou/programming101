0. General models

(p.42)
Culture: 
    traits, integrated configurations, constellations of symbols and meanings, symbolic templates, a web of meanings, taxonomic trees, measurable units of behavior, a collection of material artifacts, systems of knowledge, sets of values and beliefs, sets of characteristics strategies for accomplishing a desired goal
    exist as public artifacts "in the world" and cognitive constructs "in the mind" of members of a community
Models:
    provides a bridge between the empiricist concept of culture as "object" and the cognitive concept of culture as forms of knowledge. 
Cultural model:
    that can distinguish culture on the ground and culture in the mind

Mental model:
    Definition
        aka mental representations
        including personal and conventional (cognitive) models
        creative and adaptive simplifications of reality that may reduce complexity of reality
    Personal model (P): 
        human are adept at constructing idiosyncratic models of experience on the fly, as a basic meaning-making strategy
        Individual -> (mental model) -> physical environment
    Conventional model (Co): 
        reaction in circumstances, settings, and cultural conditions
        not personally made but special-purpose program in which one internalize as part of his own stock of ready-made responses
        schematized by people and socially constrained and reinforced by both positive and negative social feedback
    Cultural model (Cu): 
        the origin of conventional models
        born, transformed through endless social exchanges
        a shared model provides conventional resources to a community for meaning making   
        Individual ->[(mental model) -> social environment] -> physical environment

    Co->P: 
        individuals of each generation are inscribed of conventional model
        gain motivational force in a community
        conventional models become a personal cognitive resource for individuals
        conventional model + personal experience = personal models
        individuals may experience conflicting personal and conventional models for a given domain of experience
        
    P vs Cu:
        mental representations of cultural models internalize socially constrained experiences than idiosyncratic (P) models     
        cultural practices constrain attention and guide saliency are not open to much personal choices but are closely guided by social norms

    Instituted model vs conventional mental model
        called "templates", social institutionsâ€”conventional, patterned public forms such as greetings, calendars, cockfights, discourse genres, houses, public spaces, chants, conventional body postures, and even deliberately orchestrated aromas 
        such as rituals, carnival, dance, genres, or games
        lead a double life, as part of an external social world and as products of intentional behavior
        govern concept formation of newly socialized individuals, from which individuals construct conventional mental models
        distinction
            being different from conventional mental models and the distinction is of great theoretical importance
            when comparing instituted model and conventional mental model, members of a community under certain conditions will fail to fully internalize a cultural model because their personal experiences are incompatible with the conventional model
            mental representations or meaning construction can be different 
    
    Model vs foundational schema
        schema occurs within a set of specific cultural models 
        foundation schemas lose specific sensory reference to organize a wide diversity of particular models and underwrite the possibility of meaning construction in a variety of context.

    Actors' models and observers' models
        dealing with the relationship between culture and mind
        schools:
            structuralism (Levi-Strauss)
            symbolic anthropology (Geetz, Turner, and Schneider)
            ethnoscience (Frake, Goodenough, Sturdevant, Lounesbury, and Conklin)
        models
            actors': employ symbolic forms that are dynamic and graded, permitting the representation of an individual's changing relationships to any phenomenon. They are dynamic ecological models that govern the negotiation of a changing landscape.
            observer's: adapted for the representation and social coordination of abstract general perspectives. Thus observers' models tend to be organized more in terms of categories, permitting mutual rather than just personal orientation.
        
    Model Genres
        linguistic models:
            Scripts: (conventional model) standardized conversation templates for organizing interactions in well-defined, goal-oriented situations
            Propositional models: (cultural models) prepositional symbolic forms are characterized by discursiveness. discursive symbolisms as ordinary language or mathematics have a high degree of abstractness from which they derive their power to re-present experience rather than iconically modeling it
            Sound symbolic models: (conventional model) convey important information through conventional phonological patterns, in which pronunciation styles that index different contexts in a language.
            Lexical models: model forms of experience (taxonomies) with list of names, linked items, dictionaries, and clearly defined subsets of vocabularies
            Grammatical models: highly abstract models of time, space, movement, and causality that are encoded by grammatical forms such as noun classes, verb aspect, tense structures, and agent markers. 
            Verbal formulas: encode traditional wisdom, specialized knowledge, or techniques in highly conventional forms of speech
            Narrative model: (cultural model) a uniquely ambiguous status among verbal formulas; 
            Trope models: (cultural models) important linguistic models that permit language to transcend literal reference, including metaphor models, methonym models
        Nonlinguistic models:
            Image schemas: (cultural model) "image schematic models" (Lakoff, 1987a:118) and defines them as "schematic images, such as trajectories or long, thin shapes, or containers"; related to somatic experience and knowledge; or called kinesthetic schemas convey important cultural information about status, mood, and relationship.          
            Action sets: (gestural models) Simple, stylized body movements can become integrated into a coordinated interchange  
            Olfactory models: (cultural model) Because of their special relation to long-term memory, olfactory models are often used to mark special occasions, individuals, or relationships
            Sound image models: (cultural model) Many rituals use sounds as an important component
            Visual image models: (cultural model) culturally salient paintings and decorative motifs and color symbolism
    Functional distinction among models 
        Orientational models: orienting individuals to one another and to behavioral environment
            Spatial models
                Area maps of all kinds of geographic entities
                Navigational models such as Micronesian star charts (Hutchins, 1991); verbal formats for giving traveling directions
                Route maps realized in prepositional form, pictorial form, or (as is common among Australian aborigines) in song lyrics
                Models of interpersonal space, which code for aspects of power and intimacy                
                Context markers, which frame spaces as distinctive behavioral contexts (sports fields, play frames, and performance frames are all examples of spatial context markers)
            Temporal models
                Incremental models: time related progression
                Decremental models: time count-down
                Cyclical models: various spans of time as cycles
                Rhythmic models break up the flow of time into rhythmic segments for the purpose of framing musical or verbal expression
                Biographical models are conventional models for conceptualizing people's life cycles.
                Context-framing devices mark off special time frames in the same sense as spatial models frame places
            Social orientation models
                Social relation Model: lexical models mapping kin terminologies
                Social coordination: rituals, highly scripted and formalized action sets providing a shared behavioral framework for coordinating social relations
                Social role sets model the division of labor
                Emotion models: stress the orienting and communicative function
            Diagnostic models: conventional indexical models that diagnose signs of underlying states, causes, or conditions
                Medical diagnostic models: include taxonomies and divination rites as well as metonymic and metaphoric models that read somatic symptoms in relation to classifications of disease types.
                Checklists models: taking inventory of complex procedures or collections of objects or people.
                Divinatory models: strategies for uncovering hidden causes for a community's problems.
                Meteorological models: by which communities read the state of the natural world, including weather forecasting but also models for interpreting the relationships between natural events (seasons, floods, eclipses, volcanoes, storms, tides, etc.) and their social, moral and supernatural correlates.
                Intention displays are cultural models by which members of a community read each others' intentions.
        Expressive/conceptual models: share personal experience objectified, conventionalized, and transformed into cultural artifacts
            Classificatory models: based on well-formed categories, defined in terms of the intersection of more primitive semantic components or attributes.
            Ludic models: discrete performative frame, key cultural problematics
            Ritual and dramatic models: ritual and drama are important ways that communities externalize and objectify otherwise inchoate or inarticulate experiences
            Theories: provide communities with a conceptual picture of a complex state of affairs.
        Task models
            Scripts: include both verbal and nonverbal dimensions
            Recipes: conventional task models for performing complex routines
            Checklists: standardized inventories of functionally related objects or persons
            Mnemonic models: promote the memorability of important and frequently used information.
            Persuasion models: Persuasion models include a wide variety of specific conventions like prayer, sacrifice, begging, debate, sorcery, love magic, rational argument, sympathetic or contagious magic, apology, commands, and promising

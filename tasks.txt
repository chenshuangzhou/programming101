    #[meeting] stress processing/Appraisal Theory (meaning and application in questionnaire): 
        1. Intro: people have difference reactions and responses to the same event based on their own evaluations. Appraisal of an event causes an emotion, or affetive, response. 
        2. Structural Model (Lazarus, 1991):
            2.1. Primary appraisal: 
                2.1.1 evaluates two aspects of a situation: motivational relevance (relevant or irrelevant to self), motivational congruence (congruent or incongrent with one's goals)
                2.1.2 evaluation of personal significance of a specific person-environment transaction, being influenced by people's underlying assumptions or belifs about the world
            2.2. Secondary appraisal: 
                2.2.1 evaluate one's resources and options for coping
                    coping potential: problem-focused coping or emotion-focused coping
                2.2.2 evaluation of possibilities for coping and expectations regarding outcomes, being influenced by people's global meaning systems
        3. Process Model (Smith & Kirby, 2000)
            3.1 perceptual stimuli: sensation of pain or pleasure, perception of facial expression
            3.2 associative processing: memory-based process makes quick connections and provides appraisal information associated with given stimulus
            3.3 reasoning: logical, critical thinking about the stimulus and/or situation; slower and more deliberate. 
        4. Stress/Coping Framework
            4.1 demographic info, stressors, resources -> caregiver's `response to stress
            4.2 resource being a moderator affecting stress outcome
        5C. Questions:
            5.1 How many hours per day do you perceive stress?
            5.2 How many hours per day do you have to deal with the stress by yourself?
            5.3 Do you have enough resources and capability to handle the stress?
            5.4 What is your coping strategies?
            5.5 Are those still stress to you after you adopt coping strategies?
            5.6 Do you feel better after you use your coping strategies to those stress?
